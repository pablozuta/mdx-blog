Blog created with NextJS focused on web development topics, using MDX to create our blog posts, which are organized into categories for easy browsing. It also make use of TypeScript for type checking and improved code quality.

#### This is a Next.js server-side rendering function that displays an MDX blog post.

The getStaticProps function is used to generate the HTML for the post page at build time by fetching the post content and metadata from the getPostFromSlug function. The getStaticPaths function generates a list of all the available post slugs to enable the post page to be statically generated for each post.
The MDXRemote component is used to render the post content, which is in MDX format. The serialize function is used to convert the MDX content to an object that can be passed to MDXRemote as a prop. The rehypePlugins option is passed to the serialize function to apply some transformations to the HTML output of the MDX content. The transformations applied are:
rehypeSlug: adds ids to headings in the HTML output
rehypeAutolinkHeadings: wraps headings in anchor tags with the corresponding heading id as the href
rehypeHighlight: adds syntax highlighting to code blocks using highlight.js
The getStaticPaths function is used to generate a list of all the available post slugs, and the getStaticProps function is used to fetch the content and metadata for a specific post using its slug. The page is statically generated for each post using the fallback: false option. This means that if a post slug is not found in the list of paths, the build will fail.
