excerpt: I'm thinking about levels of deep work when developing new skills/knowledge , this goes from passive to more active methods for learning , from soft to intense recall methods , also how engage the thinking brain and not just memory in the process of learning. 
---


- Reading, Watching Videos about a topic (Level 1) (Passive)
- Taking Notes and Spaced Repetition (Level 2)
- Write a Summary and Elaboration (Level 3)
- Explaining a Topic Talking (Level 4)
- Writing Long Form (Level 5)
- Doing/Building using the Knowledge/Skill gained (Level 6)

Memorization is also important , it act as a platform for start adding other topics

### Reading (Level 1)
Why reading is a good method for learning?
[Will you learn better from reading on screen or on paper?](https://www.snexplores.org/article/learn-comprehension-reading-digital-screen-paper)
"Many studies have shown that when people read on-screen, they don’t understand what they’ve read as well as when they read in print."
[Reading vs Listening](https://www.dittotranscripts.com/blog/reading-vs-listening-which-is-more-effective-for-learning-and-remembering/)
"_University of California at Berkeley neuroscientists studied MRI brain scans of individuals and confirmed that the human brain is equally stimulated by both reading and listening."
"**reading is faster than listening**"

### Taking Notes and Spaced Repetition(level 2)
Why it is important taking notes of what you are reading/studing?
In which way taking notes save you time?
Why keep a record of the studied topics is good?
What Active Note-Taking Means?
[Taking Notes From Your Readings](https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/notemaking-written-text)

[Note Taking From Reading](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/studyingeffectively/organised/notetaking/index.aspx)
_"Try to make most of your notes in your own words – factual information may only be phrased in a limited number of ways, but explanations of what something says or means will be best done in your own words so you can understand the meaning"_
[10 top tips for note taking : Oxford](https://oxfordsummercourses.com/articles/how-to-take-notes-from-a-textbook/)
"_For note-taking to be productive, it needs to stimulate your brain and encourage you to really think about the information you’re writing down. In this sense, pre-determining what information you want to gain from the textbook, using memory retention techniques, and condensing your notes can all help with making sure you have fully understood the content you’re reading._"

[Research has shown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus) that we forget knowledge at predictable rates if we do not review and use that knowledge. The rate at which we forget is known as the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve.
"By practicing something repeatedly before you forget it, you are more and more likely to remember the knowledge forever."


### Writing Summaries (Level 3)
Why Writing Summaries Promotes Thinking and Learning?
Why is good to reduce information to its essential parts?

[Summary vs. Analysis](https://www.uis.edu/learning-hub/writing-resources/handouts/learning-hub/summary-vs-analysis)
_"Summaries do not evaluate, judge, or interpret the information. They present the facts as the original writer or speaker intended."_


### Explaining a Topic (Level 4) 

"[Explaining](https://www.learningscientists.org/blog/2019/8/22-1) requires you to **organize and elaborate** on the ideas that you are trying to convey to your audience. Depending on your audience, you will have to provide more details and, thereby, engage in **deeper processing of the information**. On the other hand, if you are asked to simply retrieve ideas from a text, you may be less likely to engage in elaborate structuring or re-organization of the material"
it helps you recognize 'knowledge gaps'


"When you learn something with the [intention to teach it later](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9-effect-why-teaching-someone-else-best-way-learn-simmons/), you learn it more deeply"
-   What is so interesting and valuable that it would be worth teaching to others?
-  How would I go about explaining this concept to someone else?
"Teaching reveals gaps in our knowledge. When we're aware of those gaps, we become more humble, and we ask more questions."

 [Richard Feynman Explaining Fire](https://youtu.be/N1pIYI5JQLE)

"Condensing ideas also forces you to completely rethink your teaching approach. You can't just regurgitate what you were told or what you read. You really have to transform the knowledge in your head. This means you'll have to use more metaphors and stories."

One of the more surprising findings in the learning sciences is the [testing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect).

When we practice retrieving what we have previously learned by trying to recall it from memory rather than simply highlighting it or reviewing it in written form, our retention of the information skyrockets. In other words, **every time we pull up a memory, we make it stronger and longer lasting.**


"[The _protégé effect_](https://effectiviology.com/protege-effect-learn-by-teaching/) is a psychological phenomenon where teaching, pretending to teach, or preparing to teach information to others helps a person learn that information."
-   Expecting to teach and teaching can lead to [increased metacognitive processing](https://doi.org/10.1037/edu0000071), which makes people more actively aware of their learning process.
- Expecting to teach and teaching can lead to [increased use of effective learning strategies](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13421-014-0416-z), such as organizing the material and seeking out key pieces of information. 
- Expecting to teach and teaching can lead to [increased motivation to learn](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10956-009-9180-4), since people will often make a greater effort to learn for those that they will teach, than they do for themselves.

### Writing Long Form (Level 5)
Why writing about a topic is good for learning?
[Why Students Shuould Write in all subjects](https://www.edutopia.org/article/why-students-should-write-all-subjects/)
"_“Writing about content material facilitates learning by consolidating information in long-term memory,” explain Graham and his colleagues, describing a process known as the _retrieval effect_."
[Writing to learn and why it matters]( Psychology research and learning experts [suggest](https://www.jowr.org/articles/vol7_3/JoWR_2016_vol7_nr3_Klein_Boscolo.pdf#:~:text=The%20recent%20application%20of%20more,effects%20of%20writing%20on%20learning.&text=In%20a%20recent%20meta%2Danalysis,and%20weaker%20readers%20and%20writers.) writing things down leads to better learning. Notes are helpful, sure – but the act of writing makes information stick in your memory.)
"_Writing helps us monitor what we know, as well as causing us to engage in retrieval practice: a more active form of learning._"
[4 ways to deepen understanding with writing](https://www.activelylearn.com/post/four-ways-to-deepen-understanding-with-writing-even-if-youre-not-an-english-teacher)
"_Students who reflect on how they learn tend to be more strategic in their thinking and more cognizant of what is and isn’t working in their pursuit of a learning objective._"
[To Learn Best, Write an Essay](https://www.wired.com/2011/01/learning-methods/)
_"Retrieval Practice Produces More Learning than Elaborative Studying with Concept Mapping."_
