excerpt: Deliberate practice can change the mechanisms mediating the experts’ superior performance and that the accumulated amounts of deliberate practice are related to attained level of performance.
---

"Most individuals who start as active professionals or as beginners in a domain change their behavior and
increase their performance for a limited time until they reach an acceptable level.
Beyond this point, however, further improvements appear to be unpredictable and the number of years of work and leisure experience in a domain is a poor predictor of attained performance (Ericsson & Lehmann,1996).
Hence, continued improvements (changes) in achievement are not
automatic consequences of more experience and, in those domains where performance consistently increases, aspiring experts seek out particular kinds of training tasks designed for the particular performers by their teachers and coaches (deliberate practice) (Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-Römer, 1993)." pg-52

"Several chapters in this revised handbook describe how deliberate practice can change the mechanisms mediating the experts’ superior performance and that the accumulated amounts of deliberate practice are related to attained level of performance (see Ericsson, Chapter 38)." pg-52

"Because high-level expertise is hard to acquire – for example, it is suggested that it takes thousands of hours of deliberate practice (Ericsson,Krampe, & Tesch-Römer, 1993; Ericsson & Pool, 2016) – making judgments about experts in the absence of specialist expertise is an inevitable feature of
modern society (Beck, 1992; Giddens, 1990)." pg-83

"Current ways of being can present obstacles to achieving expert
performance, even when extensive knowledge and skills are accumulated in a conventional sense (e.g. see Benner, Tanner, & Chesla, 1996; Borko et al.,2000; Dall’Alba, 2009). 
For instance, if expertise in teaching requires careful
attention to learning, then primarily improving presentation of content stands in the way of enacting expert teaching, regardless of the extent of acquired knowledge or skill (e.g. see Borko et al., 2000). 
It follows, therefore, that if targeted, deliberate practice does not take into account current ways of being,
it may be ineffective. Development can consist of merely reinforcing and refining existing ways of teaching, without the transformation that would be required in being teachers focused on monitoring and enhancing learning (for examples, see Borko et al., 2000; for examples in learning to be medical practitioners, see Dall’Alba, 2009, and Dall’Alba & Sandberg, 2006)." pg-113

"Expert performance as studied by psychologists is largely focused on secondary domains (e.g. chess, music) (Ericsson & Charness, 1994), and even in domains more closely related to primary abilities, the level of skill development is unusual from an evolutionary perspective (Epstein, 2014).
Expert performance requires deliberate practice to achieve; it does not appear to result from the natural play and exploratory behaviors that flesh out primary systems. However, as noted, expert performance does build from the scaffolding of basic modules and primary competencies." pg-132

"The achievement of chess expertise requires some
level of fluid intelligence and attentional focus (Campitelli & Gobet, 2011), along with significant, controlled practice with reliable feedback. 
By analogy,deliberate practice is to secondary competencies (and expertise, by extension)what play and exploration are for primary competencies (Ericsson, 2008). 
A key difference is that many of the attentional, cognitive, motivational, and behavioral biases that support the fleshing out of primary systems are built in,but these have to be largely constructed through deliberate, goal-directed activities for the development of competencies in secondary domains." pg-132

"...expert performance can only occur in domains in which individual difference variables (including deliberate practice) predict outcomes in performance. There is no such thing as expert performance in tic-tac-toe and other simple games, because high levels of performance are easy to achieve
and thus are a weak signal of individual differences in any underlying traits." pg-136

"Around 60,000–30,000 years ago, humans achieved “cultural modernity” which corresponds to a proliferation of symbolically mediated artifacts such as personal ornaments, engraved objects, flasks, paintings, and carved figurines (Conard, 2010; Wadley, 2001; Zilhao, 2007). 
The ability to create most of these artifacts required an apprenticeship system and deliberate practice –they are very complex artifacts and by no means intuitive to create (Stout,
2011)." pg-137

"We believe the most useful theory of human cognition and cognitive and behavioral plasticity is soft modularity, which likely evolved after our ancestors achieved ecological dominance and in response to attendant increases in social complexity and competition as well as greater ecological variability associated with range expansion. 
We used this to argue that expertise, as defined by modern psychology, largely occurs in evolutionarily novel secondary domains that necessarily involve top-down learning and
practice. 
The levels of expertise needed in these domains – and even domains that are strongly dependent on primary skills (e.g. basketball) – are likely unprecedented and increasing, because the pool of potential competitors is ever increasing and economic specialization and leisure time provide opportunities to develop expertise in evolutionarily novel ways. 
Though expressed in potentially novel ways (e.g. chess, violin), expertise in these domains probably functions as a signal of underlying traits that motivates and garners prestige for those who can display it. The signaled traits may vary to some extent (e.g. visuospatial-based as in basketball or language-based as in poetry), but most generally signal the ability and willingness to engage in effortful, deliberate practice. The latter is likely a rare and valuable trait in and of itself."
pg-139

"While modern views of expertise retain a criterion of superior
(observable, repeatable) performance, as did behaviorism, there is also considerable interest and theorizing about mediating processes and structures that support and can be developed to produce these superior performances.
Interestingly, current theorizing about the critical role of deliberate practice in the development of expertise embodies characteristics reminiscent of these earlier, neo-behaviorist approaches, such as the need for clear goals, repeated
practice experiences, and the vital role of feedback about the quality of attempts (Ericsson, Chapter 38, this volume; Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-Römer, 1993). These insights into effective learning had an important impact on efforts to improve education and training." pg-183

"Expertise (as we are defining it) is a long-term developmental and adaptive process, resulting from rich instrumental experiences in the world and extensive and deliberate practice and feedback. (A current challenge for pertinent education and training is whether and how this experiential process,
and the opportunity it provides for practice and feedback, can be compacted or accelerated, Hoffman et al., 2014)." pg-184

"In direct contrast to reaching rapidly an asymptote for performance, would-be and expert performers keep improving their performance for years and decades. Research shows that these experts engage in purposeful practice, for which they design particular training environments where they practice to attain specific changes. 
In those cases where this practice is supervised by a teacher, Ericsson et al. (1993) referred to it as deliberate
practice. In order to attain complex representations and skills it is necessary to engage in specialized training activities to build and refine these mechanisms that mediate the observed superior performance (Ericsson,Chapter 38, this volume)."
pg-215

"Research to determine how individuals achieve expert performance, rather than mere mediocre achievement, revealed that expert and elite performers seek out teachers and engage in specially designed training activities (deliberate
practice). 
The future expert performers need to acquire representations and mechanisms that allow them to monitor, control, and evaluate their own performance, so they can gradually modify their own mechanisms while engaging in training tasks that provide feedback on performance, as well as opportunities for repetition and gradual refinement." pg-218

"Excellence heavily depends on deliberate practice,
and to a lesser extent on education. Excellence is the kind of expertise that is measurable by standardized or “representative” tasks, as claimed by Ericsson (2006). The second expertise dimension is “professionalism.” This depends on socio-cognitive competence (e.g. communicative and organizational skills), and is correlated with the commitment to a profession. Professionalism is needed to turn excellence into paid work."
pg-402

"Staszewski’s data also demonstrate the problem with the claim that is sometimes made that with sufficient experience and enough rapid feedback, humans will find the relevant information if it exists. Staszewski’s landmine work suggests that the development of expertise is not that straightforward.
In some cases, a training regimen will be needed to direct the workers’ attention to critical information, and workers need to be motivated to engage in deliberate practice." pg-484

"The complexity and diversity of the mechanisms mediating skilled and expert performance are frequently intimidating. To meet these challenges it is essential to develop methods that allow investigators to collect rich data that can provide insights into the structure of an individual expert’s superior
performance, when the performance is repeatedly reproduced under
controlled and experimental conditions. 
Process tracing, in particular protocol analysis, will be essential for uncovering detailed information about most of
the important mechanisms that are responsible for the superiority of the experts’ achievement and the experts’ ability to keep improving these mechanism during designed practice. Only then will it be possible to discover their structure and study their development and refinement with training and
deliberate practice." pg-563

"Generally speaking, studies of sport expertise development frequently incorporate unique measurement tools, designed specifically for the investigation at hand. While this allows researchers to tailor the investigation to their immediate needs, it also makes comparison of results and recommendations between studies difficult, because each study tends to ask
athletes different questions in different ways. 
One notable example of this heterogeneity in methods comes in how deliberate practice is assessed.
Researchers have distinguished activities primarily engaged for fun versus for improvement or activities that are self-led versus organized by an adult.
However, depending on the research group, or sometimes on the study, these various activities have been defined as “practice” in one study, but “play” in another."

"it is through an accumulation of experience of
completing a certain task amid various constraints that permits the development of skills that can be adapted effectively to new contexts (Berstein, 1996). 
Interestingly, both the representational (Elliott et al., 2011)
and the constraints-based (Davids et al., 2008; Newell, 1989) perspectives recognize that progressive, deliberate practice that increases the complexity of a task – for example, through variable outcome goals, spaced repetition, or feedback delays – improves performance at retention. But the latter acknowledges a strategy for generalizing to new contexts." pg-923

"The premise of the theoretical framework of deliberate practice (Ericsson, 2004, 2011) is that with sufficient
time and supervised training by a teacher anyone can dramatically improve their performance with very few known immutable limits imposed by genetic endowments (e.g. height and body size)." pg-958

"One demonstration of the central role of deliberate practice is to identify individuals at various levels of expertise, as measured by an acknowledged standard, and then examine the
growth of their expertise as a function of time devoted to practice. What emerges is a now classic learning curve that only asymptotes after thousands of hours of practice (Ericsson, 2004)" pg-925

"Since expertise in many domains is so strongly dependent on an
accumulation of thousands of hours of deliberate practice, it is natural to suppose that experience and expertise are highly related, so that measures like years in practice, which reflect an accumulation of patient experiences, may be a surrogate for expertise. 
This is generally not the case (Ericsson, 2004). A
number of reviews have examined the relationship between age and various measures of clinical performance (Durning et al., 2010; Ericsson, 2004; Eva,2002). 
All have shown the same finding; a small but consistent negative relationship with age (Ericsson, 2004). The finding may reflect the distinction between practice and deliberate practice, the latter involving systematic exposure with graded difficulty and feedback." pg-928

"“Deliberate practice” is often juxtaposed to mere experience. Although deliberate practice in all its detail has not been implemented into a driver training or a hazard perception training program, the more successful training programs contain components consistent with deliberate practice as opposed
to ineffective training which resembles “mere experience.”"
pg-984

"As Ericsson and Pool (2016) define the terms, whereas naive practice may consist in nothing more than doing something repeatedly, purposeful practice is more focused on continual
improvement by repeatedly engaging in practice tasks with immediate feedback. Purposeful practice is also more effortful in pushing one out of one’s comfort zone. Deliberate practice goes one step further than purposeful practice in that it requires supervision from a trained teacher." Pg-1048

“At the foundation of the notion of deliberate
practice … is the fact that deliberate practice refers to activity that provides … opportunity for learning and skill acquisition. It is possible that activities may look very different across domains yet serve this same purpose” Pg-1065

"There are no specific types of activities per se that
qualify for being deliberate practice. Instead, they recommended refocusing on two criteria: (1) the goal of competence
improvement and (2) regularly executing an activity, which essentially encapsulate Ericsson and Pool’s (2016) concept of purposeful practice." Pg-1066

"An alternative to the strategy above is to take up Ericsson’s suggestion of focusing on representative activities that define the essence of a domain and can be mastered through deliberate practice (Ericsson, 2004). For example, in the domain of medicine Ericsson highlights that doctors may develop expert levels of performance in: (i) diagnosing test results; (ii)
patient diagnosis; and (iii) surgical procedures. These are frequently occurring activities central to the domain that clinicians and surgeons practice frequently." Pg-1066

"decomposing the entrepreneurial process into its constituent activities is a critical step in examining what aspects of performance might be conducive to deliberate practice" Pg-1069

"To qualify as deliberate practice it is necessary to meet one additional criterion, namely that the practice is supervised and designed by a teacher, who has successfully trained other individuals to attain the target performance." Pg-1070

"Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-Römer (1993) defined the characteristics of deliberate practice as: (1) effortful exertion to improve performance, (2)intrinsic motivation to engage in the task, (3) practice tasks that are selected
by a teacher to be within reach of the individual’s current level of ability within a limited amount of practice, (4) feedback that provides knowledge of results, and (5) gradual refinement from many repetitions. They contrasted
deliberate practice with work activities for pay or other external rewards and enjoyable play activities that have no goal for improving performance.
Deliberate practice can only be sustained for a limited amount of time each day because of the effort involved." Pg-1141

"A large body of work has documented the critical role of deliberate practice in the development of adaptive expertise. Deliberate practice is not to be confused with repetitive practice. Anyone with lots of experience has also
gained a lot of repetitive practice. But deliberate practice is something else.
Deliberate practice is usually a designed experience – often by a teacher or coach – not one that happens naturally (Ericsson, 2006). It usually requires a set of training tasks that are outside the current comfort range of the learner,
but not so far that they can’t be mastered in a matter of hours." Pg-1201

"According to Ericsson (2006), deliberate practice always involves conscious concentration on the skill, and informative feedback, both from the performance itself and from a coach or peers.
This requirement for concentration “sets deliberate practice apart from both mindless, routine performance and playful engagement, as the latter two types of activities
would, if anything, merely strengthen the current mediating cognitive mechanisms rather than modify them to allow increases in the level of performance” (Ericsson, 2006, p. 694)." Pg-1201

"There are a number of characteristics of teaching that work against successful implementation of deliberate practice. First among these might be the cultural assumption that teaching is not something generally subject to improvement." Pg-1201

"No matter how motivated teachers are to improve, there are other things that make it hard for them to engage in deliberate practice of teaching. Chief among these is the fact that, unlike many domains of expertise, teaching is one in which most of the teacher’s time is spent in performance, not in practice. Fadde and Klein (2010) point out that in music and sports, for
example, performance happens rarely, leaving lots of time for practice in between performances." Pg-1202

"features of deliberate practice (e.g. repetition, timely feedback,task variety, and progressive difficulty)" Pg-1202

"Expertise is reflected in the breadth of domainrelated
experiences a decision-maker has, and the store of events he/she relies on as referents when assessing a situation in context. In addition, NDM studies of experts in diverse domains have uniformly demonstrated that individuals who achieve high proficiency engage not only in deliberate practice, but deliberate performance as well (Ericsson, 2006; Fadde & Klein,
2010)."Pg-1227

"Decision Skills Training (DST) aims to accelerate the transition toward expertise by targeting the judgments and actions required by practitioners.
DST is based on an understanding of the strategies that experts use to finetune their skills to dynamically changing conditions. These strategies include:
being mindful of opportunities for learning; engaging in deliberate practice that incorporates goals and evaluation criteria; honing metacognitive skills;
seeking feedback that is accurate and diagnostic; compiling an extensive store of cases; and building mental models (Pliske, McCloskey, & Klein, 2001)." Pg-1249

"...no one ever becomes an expert in an established
domain of expert performance without first deliberately practicing for thousands of hours over many years (Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-Römer,1993; Ericsson, Prietula, & Cokely, 2007). Deliberate practice specifically refers to specialized, high concentration training efforts, often completed in solitude. These efforts are intentionally designed to move the expert past their current performance level through elicitation of specific feedback about performance weaknesses and strengths. Accordingly, deliberate practice tends to be quite challenging and cannot be routinely sustained for great periods of time (e.g. perhaps four to five hours per day on average)." Pg-1303

"In time, careful and consistent deliberate practice
efforts tend to produce remarkable differences in knowledge, skills, and abilities." Pg-1304

"A discussion about the role of training-induced changes in performance was triggered by Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-Römer (1993), who first introduced the concept of “deliberate practice.” 
Deliberate practice is a set of structured activities that experts in the domain consider important for improving performance; it is often strenuous and can therefore only be
maintained for limited amounts of time per day without danger of
psychological or physiological burnout." Pg-1443

"Thus, already relatively early in instrumental music learning, the amount of practice is significantly related to level of performance. These results have been successfully replicated in different domains.
Note that mere durations are only a proxy to the amount of deliberate practice invested, since retrospectively estimated practice durations encompass bouts of highly
effective practice as well as stretches of suboptimal practice (see discussion in Platz, Kopiez, Lehmann, & Wolf, 2014)." 
Pg-1444

"Deliberate practice combines goal-oriented, structured, and effortful practicing with motivation,resources, and focused attention. Ericsson and colleagues argued that a major
distinction between professional and amateur musicians, and generally between more successful and less successful learners, is the amount of deliberate practice undertaken during the many years required to develop instrumental skills to a high level (Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996)." Pg-1484

"The concept of deliberate practice has been refined since it became clear that not only the amount of deliberate practice, but also the point in life at which intense goal-directed practice begins are important variables. 
In the auditory domain, for example, critical periods – “windows of opportunity” – exist for the acquisition of so-called “absolute” or “perfect” pitch. 
Absolute pitch denotes the ability to name pitches without a reference pitch. It is mediated by auditory long-term memory and is strongly linked to intense early musical experience, usually before the age of 7 (Baharloo, Johnston, Service, Gitschier, & Freimer, 1998; Miyazaki, 1988; Sergeant, 1968)." Pg-1484

"Emotional and performance skills are supported by individualized prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortical
regions and in the limbic system. Self-monitoring, anticipation of the consequences of one’s actions, motivation, and focusing attention (all contributing to goal-directed “deliberate” practice), recruit a highly diverse network, including lateral prefrontal cortices, parietal cortices, limbic structures, and particularly motivational pathways, including the accumbens
nucleus, and memory structures such as the hippocampus (Zatorre &Salimpoor, 2013).
All of these regions and the interconnecting nerve fibers
are subject to modifications in function and structure in association with musical practice, a phenomenon which is based on brain plasticity." Pg-1487

"Given the importance of deliberate practice in an entrepreneurial domain such as chess, one could expect that powerful training methods have been developed.
There is not much about this topic in the literature, however.
Gobet and Jansen (2006) show how educational principles that can be used in chess training can be derived from the template theory. 
The necessity of having a coach is debated in the literature; for example, Charness, Krampe,and Mayr (1996) found a bivariate but not a unique multivariate correlation between chess skill and the presence of a coach in one sample; however,Charness, Tuffiash, Krampe, Reingold, and Vasyukova (2005) did find it in
another. 
Gobet, Campitelli, and Waters (2002) note that using computer databases and playing computers may provide more efficient training tools than traditional training practice based on books, which is consistent with the progressive replacement of the latter by the former in professional practice." Pg-1620

"As appears to be true in other domains, skill acquisition in chess requires a considerable investment. Few players reach master level performance with less than 1,000 hours of serious study (Charness, Krampe, & Mayr, 1996).
Relying on responses to retrospective questionnaires, these investigators probed a large sample of tournament players from different countries focusing on how much time they spent in serious study alone (deliberate practice) versus that spent in tournament play and analysis of games with others." Pg-1624

"A central tenet of deliberate practice theory is that for individuals to advance in skill they need to find practice activities to circumvent current limitations." Pg-1625

"Although the idea that “practice with zeal” leads to
performance improvement had been around for almost a century (Thorndike,1912), it was not until Ericsson and colleagues published their seminal paper on deliberate practice in 1993 that a conceptual framework and a methodology emerged that enabled the importance of practice to be examined
empirically." pg-1753

"Deliberate practice was defined as specific, purposeful, and challenging practice of an aspect of performance that requires improvement (Ericsson et al., 1993). It requires explicit goals, effortful repetition of the activity in question, supported by feedback. It was also claimed that deliberate practice was not inherently enjoyable and did not offer any immediate reward
(Ericsson, 2003, 2007, 2008)." pg-1753

"Researchers in sport have identified two issues with the original definition of deliberate practice. The first is with respect to the claim that deliberate practice is not inherently enjoyable, and the second concerns the issue as to whether it should be conducted alone (or one-to-one with a coach,
or in a group or team). Both of these issues remain largely unresolved." pg-1755
