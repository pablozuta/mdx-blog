## Understand the Purpose of React.js
The goal of using frameworks is to avoid reinventing the wheel to solve common problems that developers face when scaling or growing a web application. Examples include management of the user interface, user events, the DOM, and forms. Moreover, initializing a codebase with a framework simplifies things when starting out and when integrating new people into the codebase.

Frameworks also provide applications with **modularity**. In other words, they allow you to build your user interface from **components**. A component encompasses all of the **HTML, JS, and CSS** tailored to a specific need and can be **reused** in other user interfaces.

### Why React?
- Availability
- Community
- Professional Opportunities

React doesn’t directly manipulate the browser DOM. Instead, it generates a **virtual DOM**, separate from the browser DOM. When needed, it **reconciles** the virtual DOM with the browser DOM, carefully minimizing necessary operations. It allows for **optimum performance**, meaning React can be used **in various contexts** and not only within the browser, usually in native mobile apps, etc.

**We’re going to be working together to create a website for a plant shop: Jungle House!**

## 3-Write Modular Code With Components in JSX
**THINK IN COMPONENTS**
**components are fundamental to React**.
Every interface is made up of different elements: buttons, lists, headings, sub-headings. Altogether, these elements make up a **user interface**, or **UI**.
With React, each of these reusable parts is a component. They contain everything they need to function correctly: **structure, styles, and behavior** (e.g., an action triggered when clicked).
Components mean you can **reuse the same data structure**, filling it out with different datasets.
Therefore, it is every React developer’s mission to split each user interface into reusable elements, all nested within one another. Most components are created by **combining other, simpler ones**.
**DISCOVER JSX**
JSX is a JavaScript extension created by React, which means you can use syntax in the form of tags directly in the JavaScript code.

```jsx
function Header() {
    return (<div>
        <h1>Jungle House</h1>
    </div>)
}
```
 It's a **special feature of React**: unlike other frameworks where you write enriched HTML, React teams have created JSX, their own JavaScript-based syntax that allows you to **mix HTML and JS**.
 
Let’s go back to the  `<Header />`  component. It’s looking a bit lonely up there!

Let’s add a   `<Description />`  component:
```jsx
function Description() {
    return (<p>The place to buy all the plants you've ever wanted 🌵🌱🎍</p>)
}
```
two components must always be **wrapped in a single parent component**.
React wants you to **reuse components**. Therefore, you must structure your interface in component trees.  

Let’s group Header and Description together in a banner:
```jsx
function Banner() {
    return (
    <div>
        <Header />
        <Description />
    </div>
}
```
#### Manipulate Data Within JSX Components
In React, curly braces  `{`  and `}`  are also useful. Use them whenever you’re working with JavaScript expressions.

They allow you to **apply JavaScript expressions** directly to JSX for:
```jsx
<div>
The answer to life, the universe, and everything is 
{ 6 * 7 }
</div>

<div>{ alexia.toUpperCase() }</div>

<div>{ 2 > 0 ? 'Two is greater than zero' : 'This will never appear }</div>

<div>{ myTitle }</div>
	
<div>{ 42 }</div>
```
For example, if you put a description text into a variable:
```jsx
function Description() {
    const text = "The place to buy all the plants you've ever wanted"
    return (<p>{ text }</p>)
}
```
You can apply a JavaScript function on top of this, and put a few emojis afterwards:
```jsx
function Description() {
    const text = "The place to buy all the plants you've ever wanted"
    const emojis = "🤑🤑🤑"
    return (<p>{text.slice(0, 11) + emojis}</p>)
}
```
#### Give it a go
-   **Reuse the  `Banner`  component from this chapter** displaying the name of our shop. Output the heading in a JavaScript variable: it should initially be written lowercase and then transformed to uppercase with JavaScript. 
    
-   **Create a** `**<Cart />**` **component** to appear under the heading.
    
-   **The cart contains three plants**: monstera, ivy, and a bunch of flowers.
    
-   **Create three variables** for the plant prices: the monstera costs 8€, the ivy costs 10€, and the bunch of flowers costs 15€. (We'll assume a European market and thus use euros for the currency, but feel free to use your country's currency in your own application!)
    
-   **The cart contains a list (**`**<ul>**`**)**, and each element has the name of the item and the price. 
    
-   **The cart total** adds up the three prices.

See where it says  `export default`  ? This is a syntax provided in ES6, which means you don’t have to use curly braces when importing.
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) makes importing a component easy with   `import` . This tool is essential for linking files together so that the browser can interpret them.

## Incorporate Style and Assets in Your Project
how do we attribute style with a CSS class?

All you need to do is use the **`className`** attribute and specify a string. It’s possible to use several classes on one element by placing them one after the other, separated by a space. 

Under  `/src` ,  we’ll create a  `/styles`  folder for CSS files.  Let’s drag in  `index.css`  , but without forgetting to modify the relevant path to import  `index.css`  into  `index.js`

**Use Images**

```js
import logo from '../assets/logo.png'
import '../styles/Banner.css'
 
function Banner() {
    const title = 'Jungle House'
    return (
        <div className='jh-banner'>
            <img src={logo} alt='Jungle House' className='jh-logo' />
            <h1 className='jh-title'>{title}</h1>
        </div>
    )
}
 
export default Banner
```

## Increase Your Efficiency Using Lists and Conditional Rendering

**Loop Through your Content**
In code, you’ll often find that different lists of data are structured in the same way. Great news! 🤩 There's no need to strain over copying and pasting: you can **just loop through your content and generate React components from it**.
The JavaScript .map() Method
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const doubles = numbers.map(x => x * 2) // [2, 4, 6, 8]
```
In our case, you can use it to **transform a list of data** **into a list of components**.
```js
const plantList = [
    'Monstera',
    'Ficus Lyrata',
    'Silver Pothos',
    'Yucca',
    'Palm'
]
```
```js
function ShoppingList() {
    return (
        <ul>
            {plantList.map((plant) => (
                <li>{plant}</li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    )
}

export default ShoppingList
```
As you can see, for each entry in the array, it returns a  `<li>`  element.

#### Define Your Key
`key` props help React **identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed**. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to provide a stable identity.
1.  It should be **unique** within the array.
2.  It should be **stable over time** (the same source data should always have the same key= value).

**Using Keys**
you could **define a string and combine it with the item index**
```js
function ShoppingList() {
    return (
        <ul>
            {plantList.map((plant, index) => (
                <li key={`${plant}-${index}`}>{plant}</li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    )
}

export default ShoppingList
```
### Contextualize Component Content
React allows you to create lists of components, saving developers vast amounts of time. But that’s not all! You can also use the JSX to render elements in **components conditionally**.

**Conditional Rendering**
In our list of plants  `plantList.js`  , add an **`isBestSale`  category that corresponds to a  `boolean`** , which tells you whether a plant is a best seller. It looks like this:
chaining conditions
```js
{
    name: 'Monstera',
    category: 'Classic',
    id: '1ed',
    isBestSale: true
},
```
Now that we have our boolean, let's **use a conditional to display different emojis according to whether it is a best seller or not**. In  `ShoppingList.js`  , on the same level as the name, add:
```js
{plantList.map((plant) => (
    <li key={plant.id}>
        {plant.name}
        {plant.isBestSale ? <span>🔥</span> : <span>👎</span>}
    </li>
))}
```
On second thought, it might not work as a sales argument. 🤔  Instead, let’s just put 🔥  for the best sellers and nothing for the others.

To do that, **return  `null`  in the condition where you don’t want anything to be displayed**:
```js
{plant.isBestSale ? <span>🔥</span> : null}
```
Do you know what, though? There’s an even easier way to write this – you can use  `&&`  . 

Placed between curly braces,`&&` goes before a JSX element and **states that the element will only be generated if the condition is met**. So you could write:
```js
{plant.isBestSale && <span>🔥</span>}
```
**Other Methods**
You can also chain conditions.

For example, if you wanted to display the 🔥 for the plants that are both  `isBestSale`  **and** in the classic category:

```js
{plant.isBestSale && plant.category === "classic" && <span>🔥</span>}
```

Similarly, if you wanted the 🔥 to be displayed next to plants that are either `isBestSale`  **or** in the classic category:

```js
{plant.isBestSale || plant.category === "classic" && <span>🔥</span>}
```
Keep your code clean, though. If you have too many conditions, remove them from what your function returns. 😉

## Reuse Your Components With Props
### Discover the Props Syntax
Let’s go back to our plant site. We’re now going to create a new component that we’ll reuse. The idea is to create a water scale and a light scale for each plant.

We’ll reopen  `ShoppingList.js` and **add the relevant data in  `plantList`**: 

-   `water`  data, which corresponds to the recommended amount of water for each plant.
    
-   `light`  data, which corresponds to the amount of light required.
    

Starting with light, in each plant item, **add a**  **`CareScale`  component to which we’ll pass the value prop**:
```js
<CareScale scaleValue={plant.light} />
```
You get props from the **parameters of the function** that defines your component. 

So, for  `CareScale` , you have:
```js
function CareScale(props) {
    const scaleValue = props.value
    return <div>{scaleValue}☀️</div>
}

export default CareScale
```
But didn’t we say we wanted a scale from 1 to 3?

To do this, **go for a list**, which you can create manually.

You end up with:
```js
function CareScale(props) {
    const scaleValue = props.value

    const range = [1, 2, 3]

    return (
        <div>
            {range.map((rangeElem) =>
                scaleValue >= rangeElem ? <span key={rangeElem.toString()}>☀️</span> : null
            )}
        </div>
    )
}
```
Props are objects that you get from **the parameters of your function component**.

### Create Parameters
Start by **specifying a  `type`   `prop`  for the  `CareScale` component and then reuse this component** for both water and light:
```js
<CareScale careType='water' scaleValue={plant.water} />
<CareScale careType='light' scaleValue={plant.light} />
```
We can now **configure the  CareScale  component so it can generate the data** for water and light:
```js
function CareScale({ scaleValue, careType }) {
    const range = [1, 2, 3]
    
    const scaleType = careType === 'light' ? '☀️' : '💧'
    
    return (
        <div>
            {range.map((rangeElem) => scaleValue >= rangeElem ? <span                      key={rangeElem.toString()}>{scaleType}</span> : null
            )}
        </div>
    )
}
```
As you can see, we used **two different syntaxes for our props**. For  scaleType  , we assigned a  string  between quotes. However, we gave  scaleValue  the value of an object, which we passed between curly braces. 

In practice, you can give a prop any possible value in JavaScript, but syntactically, in JSX, you only have two options:

-   A  String  literal, marked by quotes. 
    
-   Curly braces  `{}`  for everything else (boolean, number, JavaScript expression, etc.).


## Manage Data Flow From Parent to Child
So props allow you to configure your components. They respond to the React logic, according to which data descends through your tree of components in a **one-way data flow**.
For props, there are two rules you have to follow:

- A parent component always passes a prop to its child: this is the only normal route of transmission.
    
- A prop is **read-only** in the component that receives it.

## Interact With Components Using Events
An event is a **reaction** to an **action** carried out by the user, such as clicking a button or entering text in a form.

declare a handleClick
```JSX
function handleClick() {
console.log("log this into the console")
}
```

now to call the code
```JSX
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
```
Let's see what it looks like when React passes the default object as a parameter to the functions indicated in the event callback:
```JSX
function handleClickEvent(e) {
console.log("this is the event: ", e)
}
```

#### Create Forms more easily with React
React simplifies form management: you can easily access the value, whether it's an input checkbox, textarea, or even a select with  onChange  .

There are two main ways to manage forms: **controlled and uncontrolled**. You should deal with the uncontrolled method swiftly because it requires less involvement from React, which encourages the use of controlled forms.
#### Delegate Control Using Uncontrolled Forms
Here's a **form** that wraps our input:
```JSX
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
    <input type='text' name='my_input' defaultValue='Type your text' />
    <button type='submit'>Enter</button>
</form>
```
And for  **`handleSubmit`**, we get:
```JSX
function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault()
    alert(e.target['my_input'].value)
}
```
Pretty simple, isn’t it? You’re delegating the work to your DOM. Indeed, uncontrolled forms mean you don't have to **manage too much information**. However, this approach is a bit less React, because it has its limitations.

#### Take Control of Your Forms
Let's create an **`inputValue`**  variable and the **function** that we'll use to change its value in the local state with  `useState`  .  

The line of code below allows us to set the initial state for  `inputValue`  and the corresponding function to modify it and to specify the default value "Ask your question here
```JSX
const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("Ask your question here")
```
Which returns a `QuestionForm`:
```JSX
import { useState } from 'react'
function QuestionForm() {
    const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('Ask your question here')
    return (
        <div>
            <textarea
                value={inputValue}
                onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
            />
        </div>
    )
}

export default QuestionForm
```
We passed a callback function to  `onChange`  to save our input value in our local state. We'll access the typed input value with  `e.target.value`  . 

`inputValue`  now has access to the content of our input at any time. We can **create a button that triggers an alert** to render our input content, like this:
```JSX
<div>
    <textarea
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
    />
    <button onClick={() => alert(inputValue)}>Alert me 🚨</button>
</div>
```
#### Understand the Benefits of Controlled Forms


It means you can **interact directly with the user's information** and display an error message if the data is invalid or filter the data to intercept invalid values.  

If we decide that the letter ‘f’ is not valid (an odd example, I know), we can declare the variable:
```JSX
const isInputError = inputValue.includes('f')
```


And display an error message (or not) according to this boolean:
```JSX
{isInputError && (
    <div>🔥 You are not allowed to use the letter “f” here.</div>
)}
```
You might not realize it just now, but this gives you great freedom as a developer in terms of the checks you want to create. You’ve got the power! 🔥

Great, I now know two methods, but when should I use controlled components and when should I use the uncontrolled version?!

It’s a case-by-case judgment. You’ll have to decide based on your constraints. When you have a quick component to do that isn't complex, uncontrolled input might be all you need. However, if you have checks to do, it’s certainly better to use a controlled component. There seem to be many more controlled components in codebases.

There are also libraries that you can use to manage forms and their validation as cleanly as possible, such as [the tool react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/).
