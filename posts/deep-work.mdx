**Deep Work:Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit**
A state of mental strain is neccesary to improve your abilities
_Daily Rituals_ by Mason Currey

Examples of historical figured that used _deep work_ :
- Michel de Montaigne
- Mark Twain
- Woody Allen
- Peter Higgs
- J.K. Rowling
- Neal Stephenson

**this stands in sharp contrast to the behavior of most modern knowledge workers**
This is because of "Network Tools":Email , social media and all the entertainment and distractions we are exposed every minute of the day in our smartphones.
Those modern knowledge workers spend 60% of the time on electronic comunication.
**fragmented attention** is the enemy of deep work

_The Shallows_ Nicholas Carr

This 24/7 distractions degrades our capacity to remain **focused**
**Our work culture's shift towards the shallow is exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few who recognize the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing depth**
Learning something like programming requires intense uninterrupted concentration; deep work. you have to **teach your mind** how to **go deep**. "_Deep Work paid off_"
Deep Work is a skill that have great value today
In this modern economy you must **master the art of quicly learning complicated things**
Your situation now has become similar to Jung trying to outwit Freud **you have to produce the absolutely best stuff you're capable of producing**

Erik Barker "deep work is the superpower of the 21st century"

## Chapter One
### Deep Work is Valuable
_Race Against the Machine_ book 2011
talks about the rise of digital technology is transforming the labor markets
**as intelligent machines improve, and the gap between machine and human abilities shrinks, employers are becoming increasingly likely to hire "new machines" instead of "new people"**
technology also is making remote work easier leaving the local talent pool underemployed
This great restructuring is not **driving down** all jobs but is instead **dividing** them
_Average is Over_ 2013 - George Mason
The Intelligent Machine Age
Three groups will thive in this new worlds
**The High-Skilled Workers**
Those with the oracular ability to work with and tease valuable results out of increasingly complex machines will thrive.
_the key question will be : are you good at working with intelligent machines?_
**The Superstars**
Once the talent market is made universally accessible, those at the peak of the market thive while the rest suffer
Talent is not a commodity you can buy in bulk and combine to reach the needed levels: **There's a premium to being the best**
An increasing number of individuals in our economy are now competing with the rockstars of their sectors
**The Owners**
Those with capital to invest in the new technologies that are driving the Great Restructuring

### How to Become a Winner in The New Economy
**Two core abilities for thriving in the new economy
1. The ability to quickly master hard things
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed

We're been spoiled by the intuitive user experience of many consumer-facing technlgies
**Most of the new machines driving the new economy are significantly more complex to understand and master**
To join the group of those who can work well with these machines requires that you hone your ability to master hard things.
You must be able to do it quickly , again and again
**To become a superstar mastering the relevant skills is necessary but not sufficient , you must transform that latent potential into tangible results that people value**
it requires to push your skills to their limit
**if you don't produce you won't thrive , no matter how skilled or talented you are**
_Those abilities depends on your skills doing deep work_

_The Intellectual Life_ Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges
**Let your mind become a lens, thanks to the converging rays of attention; let your soul be all intent on whatever it is that is established in your mind as a dominant wholly absorbing idea**
_the necessity of mastering complicated materials_
Sertillanges argues that to advance your understanding of your field you must tackle the relevant topics systematically.
**To learn requires intense concentration**
In the 70s a branch of psychology called performance psychology begin to explore what separates experts from everyone else.
In the 90s the Florida State University professor K. Anders Ericsson gave it a punchy name: **Deliberate Practice**
"_The differences between experts and normal people reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve in a specific domain_"
To master a cognitively demanding task requires this specific form of practice
Deliberate Practice
- Your attention is focused on a specific skill you're trying to improve
- You receive feedback so you can correct your approach
**Diffused attention is antithetical to deliberate practice**
_The Talent Code_ Daniel Coyle - 2009
**skills eventually reduce down to brain circuits**
The reason to focus intensely at the task at hand is to make those brain circuits stronger by isolating those neural paths.

### Deep Work Helps You Produce At An Elite Level
Adam Grant Case
He Think a lot about the mechanics of producing at an elite level
**Productivity as a Scientific problem to systematically solve**
He has periods of isolation to focus completely on a single research task.
dividing the task of writing a paper into three discrete processes ; the analysing , the draft writing , the editing.
**High-Quality Work produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)**
The best students understood the role **intensity** plays in the pursue of mastering something ; this intensity reduces the time needed without diminishing the quality of the results.
_Why it is so hard to do my work_ paper by **Sophie Leroy** 
When you switch from Task A to Task B a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task.
