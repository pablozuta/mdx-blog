"_Jung retreated to Bollingen not to escape his professional life but instead to advance it_"
**Deep Work:Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit**
A state of mental strain is neccesary to improve your abilities
_Daily Rituals_ by Mason Currey

Examples of historical figured that used _deep work_ :
- Michel de Montaigne
- Mark Twain
- Woody Allen
- Peter Higgs
- J.K. Rowling
- Neal Stephenson

**This stands in sharp contrast to the behavior of most modern knowledge workers**
This is because of "Network Tools" : Email , social media and all the entertainment and distractions we are exposed every minute of the day in our smartphones.
Those modern knowledge workers spend 60% of the time on electronic comunication.
**fragmented attention** is the enemy of deep work

### Shallow Work
Human network routers. distracted dashes that produce muted quality. 

This 24/7 distractions degrades our capacity to remain **focused**
**Our work culture's shift towards the shallow is exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few who recognize the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing depth**
Learning something like programming requires intense uninterrupted concentration; deep work. you have to **teach your mind** how to **go deep**. "_Deep Work paid off_"
Deep Work is a skill that have great value today
In this modern economy you must **master the art of quicly learning complicated things**
Your situation now has become similar to Jung trying to outwit Freud **you have to produce the absolutely best stuff you're capable of producing**

### The Deep Work Hypothesis
The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy.

Fierce concentration. commitment to depth. minimize the shallow.The ability of fully disconnect.Being Confortable with boredom.  
"_Three to four hours a day , five days a week , of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, can produce a lot of valuable output_"

## Chapter One
### Deep Work is Valuable
The rise of digital technology is transforming the labor markets
**as intelligent machines improve, and the gap between machine and human abilities shrinks, employers are becoming increasingly likely to hire "new machines" instead of "new people"**
technology also is making remote work easier leaving the local talent pool underemployed
This great restructuring is not **driving down** all jobs but is instead **dividing** them

The Intelligent Machine Age
Three groups will thive in this new worlds
**The High-Skilled Workers**
Those with the oracular ability to work with and tease valuable results out of increasingly complex machines will thrive.
_the key question will be : are you good at working with intelligent machines?_
**The Superstars**
Once the talent market is made universally accessible, those at the peak of the market thive while the rest suffer
Talent is not a commodity you can buy in bulk and combine to reach the needed levels: **There's a premium to being the best**
An increasing number of individuals in our economy are now competing with the rockstars of their sectors
**The Owners**
Those with capital to invest in the new technologies that are driving the Great Restructuring

### How to Become a Winner in The New Economy
**Two core abilities for thriving in the new economy**
1. The ability to quickly master hard things
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed

We're been spoiled by the intuitive user experience of many consumer-facing technlgies
**Most of the new machines driving the new economy are significantly more complex to understand and master**
To join the group of those who can work well with these machines requires that you hone your ability to master hard things.
You must be able to do it quickly , again and again
**To become a superstar mastering the relevant skills is necessary but not sufficient , you must transform that latent potential into tangible results that people value**
it requires to push your skills to their limit
**if you don't produce you won't thrive , no matter how skilled or talented you are**
##### those abilities depends on your skills doing deep work

### Deep Work Helps You Quickly Learn Hard Things
22/190
_The Intellectual Life_ Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges
**Let your mind become a lens, thanks to the converging rays of attention; let your soul be all intent on whatever it is that is established in your mind as a dominant wholly absorbing idea**
_the necessity of mastering complicated materials_
Sertillanges argues that to advance your understanding of your field you must tackle the relevant topics systematically.
**To learn requires intense concentration**
In the 70s a branch of psychology called performance psychology begin to explore what separates experts from everyone else.
In the 90s the Florida State University professor K. Anders Ericsson gave it a punchy name: **Deliberate Practice**
"_The differences between experts and normal people reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve in a specific domain_"
To master a cognitively demanding task requires this specific form of practice
Deliberate Practice
- Your attention is focused on a specific skill you're trying to improve
- You receive feedback so you can correct your approach
**Diffused attention is antithetical to deliberate practice**
_The Talent Code_ Daniel Coyle - 2009
**skills eventually reduce down to brain circuits**
The reason to focus intensely at the task at hand is to make those brain circuits stronger by isolating those neural paths.

#### Deep Work Helps You Produce At An Elite Level
Adam Grant Case
He Think a lot about the mechanics of producing at an elite level
**Productivity as a Scientific problem to systematically solve**
He has periods of isolation to focus completely on a single research task.

**High-Quality Work produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)**
The best students understood the role **intensity** plays in the pursue of mastering something ; this intensity reduces the time needed without diminishing the quality of the results.

## Part II , The Rules

### Rule 1
#### Work Deeply
The ancient Greek concept of eudaimonia (a state in which you’re achieving your full human potential)
“The purpose of the deep work chamber is to allow for total focus and uninterrupted work flow,” Dewane explains. He imagines a process in which you spend ninety minutes inside, take a ninety-minute break, and repeat two or three times—at which point your brain will have achieved its limit of concentration for the day.
In an ideal world—one in which the true value of deep work is accepted and celebrated—we’d all have access to something like the Eudaimonia Machine. Perhaps not David Dewane’s exact design, but, more generally speaking, a work environment (and culture) designed to help us extract as much value as possible from our brains.

Unfortunately, when it comes to replacing distraction with focus, matters are not so simple. _People fight desires all
day long._
A now voluminous line of inquiry, initiated in a series of pioneering papers also written by Roy Baumeister, has established the following important (and at the time, unexpected) truth about willpower: **You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it**.
The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.

#### Decide on Your Depth Philosophy
You must be careful to choose a philosophy that fits your specific circumstances, as a mismatch here can derail your deep work habit before it has a chance to solidify.

##### The Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling
The famed computer scientist Donald Knuth cares about deep work. As he explains on his website: “_What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration._”
Knuth deploys what I call the monastic philosophy of deep work scheduling. This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations. Practitioners of the monastic philosophy tend to have a welldefined and highly valued professional goal that they’re pursuing, and the bulk of their professional success comes from doing this one thing exceptionally well. It’s this
clarity that helps them eliminate the thicket of shallow concerns that tend to trip up those whose value proposition in the working world is more varied.
Knuth, for example, explains his professional goal as follows: “I try to learn certain areas of computer science exhaustively; then I try to digest that knowledge into a form that is accessible to people who don’t have time for such study.”

##### The Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling
In recalling this story I want to emphasize something important: Jung did not deploy a monastic approach to deep work. Donald Knuth and Neal Stephenson, our examples from earlier, attempted to completely eliminate distraction and shallowness from their professional lives. Jung, by contrast, sought this elimination only during the periods he spent at his retreat. The rest of Jung’s time was spent in Zurich, where his life was anything but monastic: He ran a busy clinical practice that often had him
seeing patients until late at night; he was an active participant in the Zurich coffeehouse culture; and he gave and attended many lectures in the city’s respected universities.
Jung’s approach is what I call the bimodal philosophy of deep work. This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else.
This division of time between deep and open **can happen on multiple scales**. For example, on the scale of a week, you might dedicate a four-day weekend to depth and the rest to open time.

The bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can produce extreme productivity, **but only if the subject dedicates enough time to such endeavors** to reach maximum cognitive intensity—the state in which real breakthroughs occur. This is why the minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day. To put aside a few hours in the morning, for example, is too short to count as a deep work stretch for an adherent of this approach.

##### The Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling
Seinfeld began his advice to Isaac with some common sense, noting “the way to be a better comic was to create better jokes,” and then explaining that the way to create better jokes was to write every day. Seinfeld continued by describing a specific technique he used to help maintain this discipline. He keeps a calendar on his wall.
Every day that he writes jokes he crosses out the date on the calendar with a big red X.“After a few days you’ll have a chain,” Seinfeld said. “Just keep at it and the chain
will grow longer every day. You’ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.”
This chain method (as some now call it) soon became a hit among writers and fitness enthusiasts—communities that thrive on the ability to do hard things consistently.
This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit, it combines a simple scheduling heuristic (do the work every day), with an easy way to remind yourself to do the work: the big red Xs on the calendar.

The rhythmic philosophy provides an interesting contrast to the bimodal philosophy. It perhaps fails to achieve the most intense levels of deep thinking sought in the daylong concentration sessions favored by the bimodalist. The trade-off, however, is that this approach works better with the reality of human nature. By supporting deep work with rock-solid routines that **make sure a little bit gets done on a regular basis**, the rhythmic scheduler will often log a larger total number of deep hours per year.

##### The Journalistic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling
What interests me about Isaacson, however, is not what he accomplished with his first book but how he wrote it.
_It was always amazing… he could retreat up to the bedroom for a while,when the rest of us were chilling on the patio or whatever, to work on his book… he’d go up for twenty minutes or an hour, we’d hear the typewriter pounding, then he’d come down as relaxed as the rest of us… the work never seemed to faze him, he just happily went up to work when he had the spare time_

Isaacson was methodic: Any time he could find some free time, he would switch into a deep work mode and hammer away at his book.

I call this approach, in which you fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule, the journalist philosophy. This name is a nod to the fact that journalists, like Walter Isaacson, are trained to shift into a writing mode on a moment’s notice, as is
required by the deadline-driven nature of their profession.
**This approach is not for the deep work novice.** As I established in the opening to this rule, the ability to rapidly switch your mind from shallow to deep mode doesn’t come naturally. Without practice, such switches can seriously deplete your finite
willpower reserves.

### Ritualize
An often-overlooked observation about those who use their minds to create valuable things is that they’re rarely haphazard in their work habits.

Charles Darwin had a strict structure for his working life during the period when he was perfecting On the Origin of Species. As his son Francis later remembered, he would rise promptly at seven to take a short walk. He would then eat
breakfast alone and retire to his study from eight to nine thirty. The next hour was dedicated to reading his letters from the day before, after which he would return to his study from ten thirty until noon. 
After this session, he would mull over challenging ideas while walking on a proscribed route that started at his greenhouse and then circled a path on his property. He would walk until satisfied with his thinking then
declare his workday done.

The journalist [Mason Currey](https://www.masoncurrey.com/),summarized this tendency toward systematization as follows:

_There is a popular notion that artists work from inspiration—that there issome strike or bolt or bubbling up of creative mojo from who knows where…but I hope my work makes clear that waiting for inspiration to strike is aterrible, terrible plan. In fact, perhaps the single best piece of advice I can offer to anyone trying to do creative work is to ignore inspiration._

This strategy suggests the following: To make the most out of your deep work sessions, build rituals of the same level of strictness and idiosyncrasy as the important thinkers mentioned previously. There’s a good reason for this mimicry. Great minds
like Caro and Darwin didn’t deploy rituals to be weird; they did so because success in their work depended on their ability to go deep, again and again—there’s no way to win a Pulitzer Prize or conceive a grand theory without pushing your brain to its limit.

There are some general questions that any effective
ritual must address:
1. Where you’ll work and for how long, Your ritual needs to specify a location for your deep work efforts.
2. How you’ll work once you start to work, Your ritual needs rules and processes to keep your efforts structured.
3. How you’ll support your work, Your ritual needs to ensure your brain gets the support it needs to keep operating at a high level of depth.

These questions will help you get started in crafting your deep work ritual. But keep in mind that finding a ritual that sticks might require experimentation, so be willing to work at it. I assure you that the effort’s worth it: Once you’ve evolved
something that feels right, the impact can be significant. To work deeply is a big deal and should not be an activity undertaken lightly.

#### Make Grand Gestures
The concept is simple: By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the **perceived importance
of the task**. This boost in importance reduces your mind’s instinct to procrastinate and delivers an injection of motivation and energy.
The dominant force is the psychology of committing so
seriously to the task at hand. To put yourself in an exotic location to focus on a writing project, or to take a week off from work just to think, or to lock yourself in a hotel
room until you complete an important invention: These gestures push your deep goal to a level of mental priority that helps unlock the needed mental resources. Sometimes to
go deep, you must first go big.

### Don’t Work Alone
**Properly leveraging collaboration can increase the
quality of deep work in your professional life.**
In MIT lore, it’s generally believed that this haphazard combination of different disciplines, thrown together in a large reconfigurable building, led to chance encounters and a spirit of inventiveness that generated breakthroughs at a fast pace,
innovating topics as diverse as Chomsky grammars, Loran navigational radars, and video games, all within the same productive postwar decades.

### Execute Like a Business
It’s often straightforward to identify a strategy needed to achieve a goal, but what trips up companies is figuring out how to execute the strategy once identified.

#### Discipline 1: Focus on the Wildly Important
As the authors of The 4 Disciplines of Execution explain, “The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish.” They elaborate that execution should be aimed at a small number of “wildly important goals.” This simplicity will help focus an
organization’s energy to a sufficient intensity to ignite real results.
**For an individual focused on deep work, the implication is that you should identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours.**

In a 2014 [column](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/03/opinion/brooks-the-art-of-focus.html) titled “The Art of Focus,” David Brooks endorsed this approach of letting ambitious goals drive focused behavior, explaining: “If you want to win the war for attention,
don’t try to say ‘no’ to the trivial distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say ‘yes’ to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else.”

#### Discipline 2: Act on the Lead Measures
Once you’ve identified a wildly important goal, you need to measure your success.
For an individual focused on deep work, it’s easy to identify the relevant lead measure: time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal.

#### Discipline 4: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard
“**People play differently when they’re keeping score**”
It’s important that they have a public place to record and track their lead measures. This scoreboard creates a sense of competition that drives them to focus on these measures, even when other demands vie for their attention. It also provides a reinforcing source of motivation. Once the team notices
their success with a lead measure, they become invested in perpetuating this performance.
**The individual’s scoreboard should be a physical artifact in the workspace that displays the individual’s current deep work hour count.**

#### Discipline 4: Create a Cadence of Accountability
The need for **regular accountability**. In multiple places throughout this book I discuss and recommend the
habit of a weekly review in which you make a plan for the workweek ahead.

The 4DX framework is based on the fundamental premise that execution is more difficult than strategizing.

### Be Lazy
_Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets… it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting
any work done.
...for decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind must be involved. For example, if you
need to do a math calculation, only your conscious mind is able to follow the precise arithmetic rules needed for correctness. On the other hand, for decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting,
constraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue.
In Ericsson’s seminal 1993 paper on the topic, titled “The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance,” he dedicates a section to reviewing what the research literature reveals about an individual’s capacity for
cognitively demanding work. Ericsson notes that for a novice, somewhere around an hour a day of intense concentration seems to be a limit, while for experts this number can expand to as many as four hours—but rarely more.

#### End your Work day with a Shutdown Ritual
Another key commitment for succeeding with this strategy is to support your commitment to shutting down with a strict shutdown ritual that you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed. In more detail, this ritual
should ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed and that for each you have confirmed that either
1. you have a plan you trust for its completion 
2. it’s captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is
right. 

The process should be an algorithm: a series of steps you always conduct, one after another. When you’re done, have a set phrase you say that indicates completion
(to end my own ritual, I say, “Shutdown complete”). This final step sounds cheesy, but it provides a simple cue to your mind that it’s safe to release work-related thoughts for
the rest of the day.

The concept of a shutdown ritual might at first seem extreme, but there’s a good reason for it: the Zeigarnik effect. This effect, which is named for the experimental
work of the early-twentieth-century psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, describes the ability of incomplete tasks to dominate our attention. It tells us that if you simply stop
whatever you are doing at five p.m. and declare, “I’m done with work until tomorrow,” you’ll likely struggle to keep your mind clear of professional issues, as the many obligations left unresolved in your mind will, as in Bluma Zeigarnik’s
experiments, keep battling for your attention throughout the evening (a battle that they’ll often win).

## Rule 2: Embrace Boredom
pg-92

To better understand how one masters the art of deep work, I suggest visiting the Knesses Yisroel Synagogue in Spring Valley, New York, at six a.m. on a weekday morning. If you do, you’ll likely find at least twenty cars in the parking lot. 
Inside,
you’ll encounter a couple dozen members of the congregation working over texts—some might be reading silently, mouthing the words of an ancient language, while others are paired together debating. At one end of the room a rabbi will be leading a
larger group in a discussion. This early morning gathering in Spring Valley represents just a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of orthodox Jews who will wake up early that morning, as they do every weekday morning, to practice a central tenet of their faith: to spend time every day studying the complex written traditions of Rabbinic Judaism.
**The goal was understand one page of the Talmud a day**

The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained. This idea might sound obvious once it’s pointed out, but it represents a departure from how most people understand such matters.
There is, however, an important corollary to this idea: Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don’t simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction. Much in the same way that athletes must take care of their bodies outside
of their training sessions, you’ll struggle to achieve the deepest levels of concentration if you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom.

## Don’t Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus.
Many assume that they can switch between a state of distraction and one of concentration as needed, but as I just argued, this assumption is optimistic: Once you’re wired for distraction, you crave it.
I propose an alternative to the Internet Sabbath. Instead of scheduling the occasional break from distraction so you can focus, you should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction.
**Schedule in advance when you’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times.**

The idea motivating this strategy is that the use of a distracting service does not, by itself, reduce your brain’s ability to focus. It’s instead the constant switching from
low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an
absence of novelty.
For example, if you’ve scheduled your next Internet block thirty minutes from the current moment, and you’re beginning to feel bored and crave distraction, the next thirty minutes of resistance become a session of concentration calisthenics. A full day of scheduled distraction therefore becomes a full day of similar mental training.

### Meditate Productively
pg-100

The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which **you’re occupied physically but not mentally** walking, jogging, driving, showering—and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem. Depending on your
profession, this problem might be outlining an article, writing a talk, making progress on a proof, or attempting to sharpen a business strategy. As in mindfulness meditation,
you must continue to bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls.
I suggest that you adopt a productive meditation practice in your own life. You don’t necessarily need a serious session every day, but your goal should be to participate in at least two or three such sessions in a typical week.

I’m not, however, suggesting this practice for its productivity benefits (though they’re nice). I’m instead interested in its ability to rapidly improve your ability to think deeply. In my experience, productive meditation builds on both of the key ideas introduced at the beginning of this rule. By forcing you to resist distraction and return your attention repeatedly to a well-defined problem, it helps strengthen your distraction-resisting muscles, and by forcing you to push your focus deeper and deeper on a single problem, it sharpens your concentration.

“Thinking deeply” about a problem seems like a self-evident activity, but in realityit’s not. When faced with a distraction-free mental landscape, a hard problem, and time to think, the next steps can become surprisingly non-obvious. In my experience, it helps to have some structure for this deep thinking process. I suggest starting with a careful review of the relevant variables for solving the problem and then storing these values in your working memory. For example, if you’re working on the outline for a book chapter, the relevant variables might be the main points you want to make in the
chapter.

----
### Suggestion #1: Be Wary of Distractions and Looping
pg-102
As a novice, when you begin a productive meditation session, your mind’s first act of rebellion will be to offer unrelated but seemingly more interesting thoughts.
When you notice your attention slipping away from the problem at hand, gently remind yourself that you can return to that thought later, then redirect your attention back.

A subtler, but equally effective adversary, is looping. When faced with a hard problem, your mind, as it was evolved to do, will attempt to ==avoid excess expenditure of energy== when possible. One way it might attempt to sidestep this expenditure is **by avoiding diving deeper into the problem by instead looping over and over again on what you already know about it.**

### Suggestion #2: Structure Your Deep Thinking
When faced with a distraction-free mental landscape, a hard problem, and time to think, the next steps can become surprisingly non-obvious.
I suggest starting with a careful review of the **relevant variables for solving the problem** and then storing these
values in your working memory.
Once the relevant variables are identified, define the **specific next-step question you need to answer using these variables.**

Assuming you’re able to solve your next-step question, the final step of this structured approach to deep thinking is to consolidate your gains by reviewing clearly the answer you identified. At this point, you can push yourself to the next level of depth by starting the process over.

### Memorize a Deck of Cards
pg-103
Ron White, a former USA Memory Champion and world record holder in card memorization.* The first thing White emphasizes is that professional memory athletes **NEVER attempt rote memorization**, that is, where you simply look at information again and again, repeating it in your head.
This approach to retention, though popular among burned-out students, misunderstands how our brains work. We’re not wired to quickly internalize abstract information. 
We are, however, **really good at remembering scenes**. Think back to a recent memorable event in your life: perhaps attending the opening session of a conference or meeting a friend you haven’t seen in a while for a drink. Try to picture the scene as clearly as possible. Most people in this scenario can conjure a surprisingly vivid recollection of the event—even though you made no special effort to remember it at the time.

----
# Rule3
## Quit Social Media
pg-107
We increasingly recognize that these tools fragment our time and
reduce our ability to concentrate.
Willpower is limited, and therefore the more enticing tools you have pulling at your attention, the harder it’ll be to maintain
focus on something important.
To master the art of deep work, therefore, you must **take
back control of your time and attention** from the many diversions that attempt to steal them.

pg-108
I will ask you to reject the state of distracted hyperconnectedness There is a middle ground, and if you’re interested in developing a deep work habit, you must fight to get there.
If you can find some extra benefit in using a service like Facebook—even if it’s small—then why not use it? I call this way of thinking the **any-benefit mind-set**, as it identifies any possible benefit as sufficient.
you’ll soon realize that network tools are not exceptional;
they’re tools, no different from a blacksmith’s hammer or an artist’s brush, used by skilled laborers to do their jobs better (and occasionally to enhance their leisure).
