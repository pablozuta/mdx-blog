excerpt: Inside an async function, you can use the await keyword before a call to a function that returns a promise. This makes the code wait at that point until the promise is settled, at which point the fulfilled value of the promise is treated as a return value, or the rejected value is thrown.

### Reacting to the complexity of asynchronous applications
_Functional Programming in JavaScript (2016)_

If you remember the last time you had to fetch remote data, handle user input, or interact with local storage, you probably recall writing entire sections of business logic into nested sequences of callback functions.This callback pattern breaks the linear flow of your code and becomes hard to read, because it’s cluttered with nested forms of success- and error-handling logic.
When building large applications, a lot of the focus has shifted from object-oriented frameworks like Backbone.js to frameworks
that favor a reactive programming paradigm.

### Challenges of asynchronous code
Modern JavaScript programs are seldom loaded in a single request; most often, data is progressively loaded on the page by multiple asynchronous requests that respond to a user’s needs.

### Access External Data
JavaScript’s resurgence is partially due to the fact that you can load a page once and then use JavaScript for all future communications to and from servers. Suddenly, you could experience websites as actual software instead of a series of discrete pages.
JavaScript is an asynchronous language. That’s a big word for a simple concept.
An asynchronous language is merely a language that can execute subsequent lines of code when previous lines of code aren’t fully resolved.

### Before Promises
Before promises, developers used callbacks to handle asynchronous actions.
If you requested expenses from a data source, you’d pass a callback function as an argument. After the asynchronous data is returned—or resolved as it is often called—the function would execute the callback.
Callbacks are a fine way to handle asynchronous data. And they were a standard tool for a long time. The problem is that you may have asynchronous functions that call asynchronous functions, that call asynchronous… Eventually you have so many nested callbacks, you find yourself in what became known as “callback hell.”As if that weren’t enough, many asynchronous functions took two callbacks:a callback for a successful response and a callback for an error. Things got complicated fast.

Promises solve the callback problem twice over. Instead of taking callback functions as arguments, promises have methods for success and failure. This keeps things visually flat. In addition, you can chain together asynchronous promises instead of nesting them. This means that you can neatly stack all
of your actions.

A promise is an object that takes asynchronous action
and calls one of two methods based on the response. If the asynchronous action is successful, or fulfilled, the promise passes the results to a then() method. If the action fails, or is rejected, the promise calls the catch() method.
Both then() and catch() take a function as an argument, and that can only take a single response argument.
```javascript
function getUSerPreferences() {
    const preferences = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        resolve({
        theme: 'dusk',
         });
        });
        return preferences;
}
```
Here’s an example of calling a code and running a function on successful resolution using the then() method.
```javascript
getUserPreferences()
.then(preferences => {
  console.log(preferences.theme);
})
```
In this case, things went well, but you should always have a backup plan.Whenever you set up a promise, you can have both a then() and a catch() method. The then() method will handle the resolutions. The catch() method will handle the rejections.
Promises took the JavaScript world by storm. They’re an amazing tool that can help you make otherwise ugly code gorgeous and easy to read.

### Create Clean Functions with Async/Await
Developers usually talk about the new syntax, async/await, as a group, but it’s really two separate actions. You use the async keyword to declare that an encapsulating function will be using asynchronous data. Inside the asynchronous function, you can use the await keyword to pause the function until a value is returned.This doesn’t replace promises. You’re merely wrapping promises in a better syntax.
```javascript
async function getTheme() {
    const {theme} = await getUserPreferences();
    return theme;
}
```
async functions really shine when you’re working with multiple promises.
With async/await, you can assign each return statement to a variable before passing the variable to the next function. In other words, you can transform your chained promises into a series of function calls in a single wrapping function.
```javascript
async function getArtistByPreference() {
    const {theme} = await getUserPreferences();
    const {album} = await getMusic(theme);
    const {artist} = await getArtist(album);
    return artist;
}

getArtistByPreference()
.then(artist => {
  console.log(artist);
})
.catch(e => {
  console.error(e);
});
```
async/await functions can clean up your code, but again, use them with caution, particularly when you’re compiling your code to earlier versions of JavaScript.

### Keeping Your Promises
Asynchronous programming is a way of life in JavaScript. Unless a method returns instantaneously, we should never call it with the intention of waiting for a response. Most functions in JavaScript libraries and frameworks are asynchronous. Although making a call and getting the results later is not new in JavaScript, the mechanics of this have evolved over the past few years.
The traditional approach to asynchronous programming was to use callbacks.Unfortunately, as we’ll soon discuss, there are many issues with callbacks.In modern JavaScript, promises replace callbacks for asynchronous programming.A code that returns a promise is nonblocking and will eventually return a result or an error to the caller through the promise.

Promises are arguably better than callbacks, but there’s a bit of ceremony in using them. When compared to the structure of synchronous imperative style code, they are different and require some planning. There are benefits to keeping the code structure the same for both synchronous and asynchronous programming—that’s where async and await come in.

**A promise is an object through which a function may propagate an error or result sometime in the future. At any time, a promise is in one of three states: pending, resolved, or rejected.**
