## Part I - Navigate ASP.NET Core MVC

### Understand What .NET MVC is

**What is .NET Core MVC?** 
The MVC acronym refer to the desing pattern model-view-controller.ASP.NET MVC is a framework for building web applications using this pattern and a replacement to the slow Web Forms. The MVC framework also adds the ability to incorporate RESTful API development.

**Why Do I Need To Learn it?**
The answer is simple. If you want to be competitive as a .NET developer you must know and understand .NET MVC. There are more unfilled positions in the world which list C# and .NET as desired skills than for any other language.


### Run Your First .NET MVC Project

**Create a new Azure Account**

**Build a New Project**
ASP.NET web application (Model-View-Controller), Individual user accounts.Store user accounts in app.

**Initialize the Database**
```
update-database
```
**Test User Registration and Login**

**Anatomy of a .NET MVC Project**
The models folder contains all of the View models (C# classes) that will be used to render data from your database to the browser.
The Views folder contains all of the HTML pages that will render the data represented by the models.
The Controllers folder contains the controller classes that process the data , constructs the models and invokes the views on the server, returning them in response to each request.

The names of each controller are also the names of the subfolders within the Views folder. This is how the MVC routing knows which view to render and where to find it.
```
[domain][controller][action]
```
The controller name is the first part of the URL after the domain name , it is followed by the controller action being invoked , it is also the name of the HTML page within the view folder that matches the controller.
```
https://yourdomain.com/movies/create
```
It navigates to the "movies" controller find the "create" action method within it  , that code method return a dynamic HTML page rendered using the the view named "Create.cshtml".

The subfolder "Shared" inside the Views folder can be called from any controller. The Shared folder also contains two other types of views: "layouts" and "partial" , layouts contains code that is common to multiple pages such as navbars and footers.
Partial views are small HTML snippets that are used repetitively across multiple pages , pretty much as react or vue components.

**Object Relational Mapping and the Database Context**
In the Data Folder 
- Migrations Folder
- *.cs ApplicationDbContext File
The Migrations folder contains all the code Entity Framework generates to build your database.
The ApplicationDbContext class is the code representation of your database, you use it to interact with your database through object-relational-mapping(ORM).

## Part II - Set Up a Simple MVC Application With ASP.NET Core

### Understand the MVC Process Flow
**The MVC Process Flow**

Step 1: From Concept to Data Model
You begin with a concept and a list of requirements. MVC apps are typically **data-driven** so the first part of the app you design will always be the data model.
**Identify The Data Entities(Objects)**
There are 4 entities in our app:
- User - There are multiple users in our system.
- Watchlist - Every user has one watchlist.
- Movie - Every watchlist has multiple movies.
- Rating - Every movie in a watchlist has one rating.

How would you define the relationshipt between these entities?
1. Each user has a single watchlist.
2. Each watchlist has multiple movies.
3. Multiple users can rate the same movie so the rating has to be linked to both the user and movie.

Step 2: From Data Model to Controller
Controllers in MVC are the action areas. They handle HTTP requests and responses. There is a one-to-one relationship between a model and a controller.
A movie controller will allow to add, edit, delete and list movies from the database by generating a view (HTML page) that correspond to the HTTP request.

Step 3: From Controller to View
The view is invoked by the return statement in the controller action:
```csharp
return View();
```
This calls the View method , this method looks for a view file in the Views folder that matches the current action and controller by name and loads the appropiate layout file for the view , reads the Blazor and HTML code building a dynamic HTML file that is send to the requeesting browser client.

**The Joy of Layouts**
Layouts let you break up HTML pages into reusable chunks. In a .NET MVC project, you can create as many custom layout as you need, you can even change the layout based upon the user requesting the page.


### Build The Data Model of Your App
**Design a Data Model**
For the user entity we need: email and password for the login, since we are using Entity Framework and Identity these properties will already be present along with an Id property that also serves as the **primary key**.
Each of the other objects should have a primary key as well.
Each user would have only one watchlist that would contain multiple movies.

**Codel the Model Classes**
There are two primary entity classes: Movie and User.
Data Folder => Add => Class => Movie.cs
```csharp
public class Movie
{
    public int Id {get; set; }
    public string Title {get; set; }
    public int Year {get; set; }
}
```
