### Before You Learn React
React apps are built using modern JavaScript features, which are commonly known as ES6.
Here are some of the JavaScript topics that you need to be comfortable with before you begin your journey learning React.

-   Data types 
-   Using var, let and const 
-   Conditionals and Loops 
-   Using objects, arrays and functions 
-   ES6 Arrow functions 
-   In-built functions such as map(), forEach() and promises. 
-   Destructuring Arrays and Objects 
-   Error Handling

**You need to be comfortable with using npm as your package manager**, since you will be using npm to install packages within your React application.  Make sure you are aware of how to do the following with npm before you get started on this course.

-   Installation command to install npm modules in your project 
-   Installing a package as a dev dependency 
-   Start command 
-   Updating npm version 
-   Navigating around the package.json file

### JavaScript modules, imports - exports
In JavaScript, a module is simply a file.
The purpose of a module is to have more modular code, where you can work with smaller files, and import and export them so that the apps you build are more customizable and have more composable parts.
A module can be as simple as a single function in a separate file.
Consider the following function declaration:
```js
function addTwo(a, b) {
   console.log(a + b);
}
```
Say that you have a file named **addTwo.js** that contains only the above code.
How would you make this file a JavaScript module?

#### **Module Exports**

There is more than one way to export a module in JavaScript.
In general, there are two ways to export modules in JavaScript:
1.  Using default exports 
2.  Using named exports
#### **Default Exports**

You can have **one default export** per JavaScript module.

Using the above **addTwo.js** file as an example, here are two ways to perform a default export:
```js
export default function addTwo(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
}
```
Here's an alternative syntax:
```js
function addTwo(a, b) {
   console.log(a + b);
}

export default addTwo;
```
### **Named Exports**

Named exports are a way to export only certain parts of a given JavaScript file.

In contrast with default exports, you can export as many items from any JavaScript file as you want.

In other words, there can be only one default export, but as many named exports as you want.

For example:
```js
export function addTwo(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b)
}

export function addThree(a, b, c) {
    console.log(a + b + c)
}
```
Here's another way you could do it
```js
function addTwo(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b)
}

function addThree(a, b, c) {
    console.log(a + b + c)
}
export {addTwo, addThree};
```
#### **Importing Modules**

Just like when exporting modules in JavaScript, there are several ways to import them.

The exact syntax depends on how the module was exported.

Say that you have two modules in a folder.

The first module is **addTwo.js** and the second module is **mathOperations.js**.

You want to import the **addTwo.js** module into the **mathOperations.js** module.
```js
import addTwo from './addTwo';
```
So, you could start this import with the import keyword, then the name under which you’ll use this imported code inside the **mathOperations.js** file. You would then type the keyword from, and finally the location of the file, _without the .js extension._

Contrast the above import of the default addTwo export with the different import syntax if the addTwo function was instead a named export:
```js
import {addTwo} from './addTwo';
```
Please note that there are **many more caveats, rules, and implementations of working with modules in JavaScript.**
