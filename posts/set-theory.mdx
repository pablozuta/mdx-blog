excerpt: Set theory is the branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which can be informally described as collections of objects. Although objects of any kind can be collected into a set, set theory, as a branch of mathematics, is mostly concerned with those that are relevant to mathematics as a whole.

The concept of a set plays a very significant role in all branches of modern mathematics.
Sets are used to group **distinct objects together** . It is necessary that the objects which belong to a set are well-defined in the sense that there should be no ambiguity in deciding whether a particular object belongs to a set or not.

The objects that belong to a set **need not possess a common property**. Thus the number 4, the letter x, and the word “book” can constitute a set S which may be represented as S = {x, book, 4}.
A set is a collection of distinct objects. The objects in a set are called the elements or members of the set.

### Finite and Infinite Sets
A set is **finite** if the number of elements in it is finite. Otherwise, it is an **infinite set**. The set of positive integers less than 100 is a finite set, whereas the set of all positive integers is an infinite set.
If X is a finite set, the cardinality of X is the number of
elements that belong to X, and this nonnegative integer is denoted by N(X). A set of cardinality 1 is called a **singleton set.**
### Subsets of a Set and the Empty Set
A set P is a **subset** of a set Q if every element of P is an element of Q. We use the notation P ⊂ Q to denote that P is a
subset of Q.
Two sets are **disjoint** if they have **no elements in common**. On the other hand, two sets are equal if they have the same elements.
A set is **empty** if it has no elements. A fact emerges that some people find surprising: there is only one empty set.

### Intersections and Unions of Sets
There are two important constructions that can be applied to subsets of a set to yield new subsets. Suppose that A and B
are two subsets of a set X. The set consisting of all elements common to both A and B is called **the intersection of A and B**
and is denoted by A ∩ B.
The set consisting of all elements that belong to either A or to B or to both A and B is called **the union of A and B** and
is denoted by A ∪ B.

### Venn Diagrams of Sets

A very useful and simple device to represent sets graphically for illustrating relationship between them is the **Venn diagram**,
named after the English logician John Venn (1834–1923). In a Venn diagram, the universal set U that contains all the objects
under consideration is usually represented by a rectangle, and inside this rectangle subsets of the universal set are
represented by circles, rectangles, or some other geometrical figures.
