excerpt: This is a book about doing data science with Python, which immediately begs the question: what is data science? It's a surprisingly hard definition to nail down, especially given how ubiquitous the term has become.

## CHAPTER 2
### Introduction to NumPy
Datasets can come from a wide range of sources and a wide range of formats, including collections of documents, collections of images, collections of sound clips, collections of numerical measurements, or nearly anything else. Despite this apparent heterogeneity, it will help us **to think of all data fundamentally as arrays of numbers**.

For example images—can be thought of as simply twodimensional arrays of numbers representing pixel brightness across the area.
Text can be converted in various ways into numerical representations, perhaps **binary digits representing the frequency of certain words** or pairs of words.

**efficient storage and manipulation of numerical arrays is absolutely fundamental to the process of doing data science.**

#### NumPy
NumPy (short for Numerical Python) provides an efficient interface to **store and operate on dense data buffers**. In some ways,NumPy arrays are like Python’s built-in list type, but NumPy arrays provide **much more efficient storage and data operations as the arrays grow larger in size**.
NumPy arrays form the core of nearly the entire ecosystem of data science tools in Python.

```python
import numpy as np
```
#### Understanding Data Types in Python
Effective data-driven science and computation requires understanding how data is stored and manipulated.
The standard Python implementation is written in C. This means that every Python object is simply a cleverly disguised C structure, which contains not only its value, but other information as well.
**This means that there is some overhead in storing an integer in Python as compared to an integer in a compiled language like C**
All this additional information in Python types comes at a cost,which becomes especially apparent in structures that combine many of these objects.
#### A Python List Is More Than Just a List
The standard mutable multielement container in Python is the
list. We can create a list of integers as follows:
```python
L = list(range(10))
```

we can even create heterogeneous lists
```python
L3 = [True, "2", 3.0, 4]
```
This flexibility comes at a cost: to allow these flexible types, each item in the list must contain its own type info, reference count, and other information—that is, **each item is a complete Python object.**
The advantage of the list is flexibility: because each list
element is a full structure containing both data and type information, the list can be filled with data of any desired type. Fixed-type NumPy-style arrays lack this flexibility,
but are **much more efficient for storing and manipulating data.**

#### Fixed-Type Arrays in Python
Python offers several different options for storing data in efficient, fixed-type data buffers. The built-in array module (available since Python 3.3) can be used to create dense arrays of a uniform type:
```python
import array
L = list(range(40))
A = array.array('i', L)
print(A)
```
Here 'i' is a type code indicating the contents are integers.

**Much more useful, however, is the ndarray object of the NumPy package**. While Python’s array object provides efficient storage of array-based data, NumPy adds to this **efficient operations on that data.**

#### Creating Arrays from Python Lists
First, we can use np.array to create arrays from Python lists:
```python
comala_array = np.array([1, 4, 6, 8, 34])
```
Remember that unlike Python lists, **NumPy is constrained to arrays that all contain the same type.**

If we want to explicitly set the data type of the resulting array, we can use the dtype
keyword:
```python
el_llano_array = np.array([2, 5, 65, 98], dtype='float32')
```

Finally, unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays can explicitly be multidimensional
```python
el_grito_array = np.array([range(i, i + 3)for i in [2, 4, 6]])
```

#### Creating Arrays from Scratch
Especially for larger arrays, it is more efficient to create arrays from scratch using routines built into NumPy.
Create a length-10 integer array filled with zeros

Create a length-10 integer array filled with zeros
```python
np.zeros(10, dtype=int)
```
Create a 3x5 floating-point array filled with 1s
```python
np.ones((3, 5) dtype=float)
```

Create a 3x5 array filled with 3.14
```python
np.full((3, 5), 3.14)
```
Create an array filled with a linear sequence Starting at 0, ending at 20, stepping by 2
```python
np.arrange(0, 20, 2)
```
