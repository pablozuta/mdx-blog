Anxiety is caused by a lack of control,organization, preparation, and action.—David Kekich

two key objectives: 
1. Capturing all the things that need to get done—now, later, someday, big, little, or in between—into a logical and trusted system outside of your head and off your mind
2. Disciplining yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the “inputs” you let into your life so that you will always have a plan for “next actions” that you can implement or renegotiate at any moment.

### The Problem: New Demands, Insufficient Resources
_pg-23_
Almost everyone I encounter these days feels he or she has too much to handle and not enough time to get it all done.

In the old days, work was self-evident. Fields were to be plowed, machines tooled, boxes packed, cows milked, widgets cranked. You knew what work had to be done—you could see it. It was clear when the work was finished, or not finished.

Now, for many of us, there are no edges to most of our projects. Most people I know have at least half a dozen things they’re trying to achieve right now.
How much available data could be relevant to doing those projects “better”? The answer is, an **infinite amount**, easily
accessible, or at least potentially so, through the Web.

The average professional is more of a free agent
these days than ever before, changing careers as
often as his or her parents once changed jobs.
Even fortysomethings and fiftysomethings hold to
standards of continual growth.

Little seems clear for very long anymore, as far as what our work is and what or how much input may be relevant to doing it well. We’re allowing in huge amounts of information and communication from the outer world and generating
an equally large volume of ideas and agreements with ourselves and others from our inner world. And we haven’t been well equipped to deal with this huge number of internal and external commitments.

### The Old Models and Habits Are Insufficient
_pg-28_
The traditional approaches to time management and personal organization were useful in their time. They provided helpful reference points for a workforce that was just emerging from an industrial assembly-line modality into a new kind of work that included choices about what to do and discretion about when to do it.
At the other end of the spectrum, a huge number of business books, models,seminars, and gurus have championed the “bigger view” as the solution to dealing with our complex world. Clarifying major goals and values, so the thinking goes, gives order, meaning, and direction to our work.
There has been a missing piece in our new culture of knowledge work: a system with a coherent set of behaviors and tools that functions effectively at the level at which work really happens. It must incorporate the results of big-picture thinking as well as the smallest of open details. It must manage multiple tiers of priorities.

### The Promise
There is a way to get a grip on it all, stay relaxed, and get
meaningful things done with minimal effort, across the whole spectrum of your life and work. You can experience what the martial artists call a “mind like water” and top athletes refer to as the “zone,” within the complex world in which you’re engaged.
It’s a condition of working, doing, and being in which the mind is clear and constructive things are happening.
**Your ability to generate power is directly proportional to your ability to relax.**

### Mind Like Water
In karate there is an image that’s used to define the position of perfect readiness:
“mind like water.” Imagine throwing a pebble into a still pond. How does the water respond? The answer is, totally appropriately to the force and mass of the input; then it returns to calm. It doesn’t overreact or underreact.
**The power in a karate punch comes from speed, not muscle**

### The Principle
_pg-36_
A basic truism I have discovered over twenty years of coaching and training is that most of the stress people experience comes from inappropriately managed commitments they make or accept.

You’ve probably made many more agreements with yourself than you realize, and every single one of them—big or little—is being tracked by a less-thanconscious part of you. These are the “incompletes,” or “open loops”.
It’s likely that you also have more internal commitments currently in play than you’re aware of. Consider how many things you feel even the smallest amount of responsibility to change, finish, handle, or do something about.
In order to deal effectively with all of that, you must first **identify and collect** all those things that are “ringing your bell” in some way, and then plan how to handle them. That may seem like a simple thing to do, but in practice most people don’t know how to do it in a consistent way.
