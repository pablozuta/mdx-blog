## Matplotlib

#### Visualize Uncertainty
Another aspect of plotting is the **_degree of uncertainty associated with estimates_.**
To visualize uncertainty we are going to use what we call **error bars**.

##### Discrete Data
In the case of discrete data, we often use error bars to represent the uncertainty inherent to each point's value. Often, the length of the bars matches the _standard deviation_ of the _empirical observations_.
```python
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 50)
dy = 0.8
y = np.sin(x) + dy * np.random.randn(50)
plt.errorbar(x, y, yerr=dy, fmt='.k');
plt.show()
```
`Errorbar` takes as argument the x-coordinates, y-coordinates and lengths of each bar (one bar per point)  `yerr` . Note the  `fmt`  argument. It allows you to choose the color (here black) and the shape of the markers on the graph in a really concise way.  `Errorbar`  also allows you to further customize the appearance of the graph.
```python
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 50)
dy = 0.8
y = np.sin(x) + dy * np.random.randn(50)
plt.errorbar(x, y, yerr=dy, fmt='o', color="black",
			ecolor='lightgray', elinewidth=3, capsize=0);
```

### Customize your plots
Up to this point, we have been constructing plots from the ground up, but you can actually use a set of _preconfigured_ properties called **styles**.
 let's print the first six styles that we have.
 ```python
 print(plt.style.available[:6])
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
for i in range(6):
    fig.add_subplot(3, 2, i + 1)
    plt.style.use(plt.style.available[i])
    plt.plot(x, y)
    plt.text(s=plt.style.available[i], x=5, y=2, color='red')
```

## Explore your data visually with Seaborn
==Seaborn  is a library that improves Matplotlib's functionality, replaces some default settings and functions, and adds new features.==

Seaborn was created to correct three **defects of Matplotlib.** As a standalone, Matplotlib:

-   Can't generate graphics of high aesthetic quality (especially in pre 2.0 versions).
    
-   Lacks the functionality to easily create sophisticated statistical analyses.
    
-   Features functions that aren't designed to interact with Panda Dataframes (which we will see in the next chapter).
    

Luckily, Seaborn addresses these problems! It still uses Matplotlib "under the hood", but does so by exposing more intuitive functions.
```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.set()
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 500)
y = np.random.randn(500)
plt.plot(x,y)
plt.show()
```
Seaborn also provides us with functions to generate useful plots for statistical analysis. For example,`distplot` lets you not only view the histogram of a sample, but also estimate the distribution from which the sample is derived.
```python
sns.distplot(y, kde=True);
plt.show()
```

As I mentioned, ==Seaborn is really good at visualizing relationships and helping us draw insights from our data. What we will do now is demonstrate Seaborn's capacities using a very simple dataset called "Iris". This dataset is popular in introductory stats classes.==

It contains 150 rows done on 3 different plant species. Each row is an observation of a certain species of plant. The observation contains quantitive columns including length and width of its sepals and petals.
```python
iris = sns.load_dataset('iris')
iris.head()
```
We can actually visualize the _relationship_ between all these variables using a powerful function in Seaborn called `.pairplot`.
Conveniently, you only need one line of code to do this with Seaborn! We simply need to pass "Iris" as the data parameter, set the hue to _species_, and the size to _2.5_.
```python
sns.pairplot(iris, hue='species', height=2.5);
plt.show()
```
