excerpt: A falsy (sometimes written falsey) value is a value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context.
JavaScript uses type conversion to coerce any value to a Boolean in contexts that require it, such as conditionals and loops.

## Shorten Conditionals with Falsy Values
_Simplifying JavaScript_ Pg-75

Responding one way to some information and a different way to other information is about as basic as programming can get.
The secret to being able to check values quickly is to understand the subtle difference between the primitive values true and false (also called Boolean types) and the many so-called truthy and falsy values—values that aren’t identical
to the Boolean values true or false but act like they are in most cases.

```js
if ("") {
  return 'I am not false';
} else {
  return 'I am false :(';
}
```

**The ones that are worth memorizing are 0, null, and an empty string.**
Arrays and objects, even empty arrays and objects, are always truthy.you’ll have to find another way to check emptiness with either [].length or Object.keys({}).length, which will give you either 0 or a nice truthy number.

```js
const employee = {
  name: 'Eric',
  equipmentTraining: '',
}
if (!employee.equipmentTraining) {
  return 'Not authorized to operate machinery';
}
```
You don’t need the code to know anything about when they received their equipment training. The code doesn’t need to know if it’s a date or a certificate name. All that the code needs to know is that the value exists and there’s something there.
