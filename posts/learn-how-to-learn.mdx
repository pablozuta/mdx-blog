## 1- Adopt a Mindset That Encourages Learning

#### Reimagine Your Relationship With Learning

**book** _Mindset:The New Psychology of Success_
The model developed by professor [Carol Dweck](https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/):
- Fixed Mindset
- Growth Mindset

**Recognize a fixed mindset**
Thinking that the ability to grow is predetermined and limited
Psychologycal constrains / Limiting Beliefs
**Learned helplessness** result from negative experiences , punishment and humilliation , creates a pessimistic view of our ability to learn.
**Modelling** surronding yourself with people with fixed mindsets
"a fixed mindset is contagious"
All this creates an unhealthy relationship with learning and an unhealthy realationship with **failure** and **criticism**
"_failure is a crucial part of everyone's learning process_"

A fixed mindset is also nurtured by the idea that we are born with a certain amount of intelligence
Neuroscience show us that our brain is **highly plastic**
As a human being you learn all the time but the joy with which you learn will depend on how you **cultivate** and **develop** your capacity to learn

#### Adopt a Growth Mindset
A growth mindset is the believe that intelligence and abilities develop and evolve
People with a growth mindset exhibit more resilience and perseverance and understand that they can't master something without effort and difficulty
"_A growth mindset is one of optimism , determination and humility_"

#### Various Intelligences and Learning Styles
**The diversity of Intelligence**

Theory of multiple intelligences developed by [Howard Gardner](https://www.howardgardner.com/) at Harvard University
"_Intelligence is not of one type_"

#### Learning Styles
All have different styles that we like to learn
Here are seven
- visual
- auditory
- linguistic
- practical
- reflexive
- social
- logical/theoretical
You will usually **combine** these styles when you're learning but some styles may be more effective or natural than others
**Recognizing your preferred learning style is very helpful**

#### Learning Methods
A learning method is a specific process or learning activity
_The self directed learning handbook_ - Maurice Gibbons
71  methods
**In Practice**
- 8 methods that you know are most effective for you
- 5 methods that you have never used but you feel excited to try out
- 3 methods that you have never used and that you feel challenged to try out
Choose one method from each of the three list above

### Adopt useful and inspiring learning principles
**10 Learning Principles**
_A principle is a proposition that serves as the foundation for a system of belief or behavior_
This 10 principles comes from the [Alternative University of Bucharest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_alternative_universities)

1. I Craft Myself Consciously :choosing what you want to learn , what you know is an essential part of your identity, know who you **want to be in the future**
2. I can Learn Anything, Anytime :you can learn **anything** you are willing to put enough effort into. Any time is a good time , it only requires your decision.
3. Learning Happens Outside The Classroom :You don't need a classroom or a formal process to learn. You can self-direct your learning. You can choose your teachers and design your programs. You learn all the time , most education comes from everyday life
4. Learning is Connected to the Environment: **Where and with Whom you learn affects learning**. Physical , virtual and social environments influence your abilities and motivation. Diferent to learn in the subway that in the park. an appropiate learning environment is very personal.
5. Learning is Meaningful: **We most easily learn what is meaninful for us**. Give meaning to your learning.be clear on why or how it is meaninful for you.
6. Learning is Fun: The Joy of Learning is one of the greatest rewards that comes from acquiring **self-direction**
7. Learning Involves Changing my Brain: Learning is about changing your brain and yourself, it is about modifying your **cognitive structure**
8. I Integrate Failure: Turn Failure into learning , it is empowering to transform failure into knowledge
9. I take Responsibility for my own Learning: Other people can help you learn but nobody can learn for you ; you are in charge. Learning is your Choice.
10. We are All Learners: Learning is a fundamental characteristic of being human . Everyone has something to teach and something to learn , it is a horizontal relationship.

## 2- Conduct your learning in an autonomous way
(look for self-directed learning material)


----
## 3- Create your personalised learning plan

### Define Your Strategic Goal
**Use an analysis tool to prepare your learning plan**
A strategic goal provides direction for your learning on the macro-level
1. A general direction for your learning
2. A field , collection of disciplines or subjects for study


In SDL, learning is never static. As in the rest of life, it is usually moving toward action. The action process comprises related skills that students must learn in order to function successfully: goal setting, planning, selfmanagement,
problem solving, and self-assessment. Thinking independently
prepares students to decide what to learn and accomplish, but in
formulating their own activities, they must turn inward to discover their strengths and interests. With a goal that matters, students are ready to devise a plan of strategies in sequence to achieve it efficiently. Once the plan is in place, they can consider how to manage it successfully: how to schedule
time, gather resources, and remain motivated to the end. When students launch their learning plans, they record their activities, especially the problems they face, solutions they devise, and the modifications in their plans that result. Finally, they devise a means of assessment that enables them to
monitor their progress and demonstrate to others the level of success that they have achieved. Learning the skills of thinking independently and taking productive action equip students for SDL and for learning throughout their lives.
_The Self-Directed Learning Handbook Pg-19_

### Prioritise your subjects of study
(search info)

### Assess Your Current Level
Bear in mind that "time invested" is not the only factor you'll need in order to advance along your learning curve for a given subject. You may have heard of the 10,000 hour rule - the idea that experts had to invest approximately 10,000 hours into a subject in order to attain their level of competence. This is a useful estimate because it puts a learning curve - and the work involved in mastering a subject - into perspective. It helps add measurability to a learning plan and a learning log.
[The 10,000 Hours Rule Is a Myth](https://lifehacker.com/the-10-000-hours-rule-is-a-myth-1819512038)
"This distinction between deliberate practice aimed at a particular goal and generic practice is crucial because not every type of practice leads to improved ability"

### Specify Your Target Level
Your target level is the micro-goal you set for each subject of study.

**What are SMART goals?**
The [SMART](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals#:~:text=What%20are%20SMART%20goals%3F,within%20a%20certain%20time%20frame.) in SMART goals stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.
A target level that is sufficiently specific, measurable and time-based is easier to aim for.
-   To maximise your progress, keep a _register_ of your study subjects and a _log_ of your study sessions.
 
    -   list your subjects for study,
    -   assess your current level,
    -   define your target level and
    -   break your subject of study down into _actions_

#### Break Down Your Subjects For Study Into Actions
Think of every action as something that requires training. It is not something you will do only once. You will do it until you achieve the competence level you need for your micro-goal.

Each of these actions will require training sessions. **Designing these training sessions is key to being a self-directed learner.** Here is where the learning principles come into play as guidelines; and where your knowledge about learning styles and learning methods is valuable.

Training sessions are usually of three types:

1.  **Deliberate practice**, for learning through self-guided exercises.
    
2.  **Guided sessions**, for learning from others.
    
3.  And **complementary activities**, for other forms of learning, like reading or reflecting.
    

Training sessions should have a **do-and-improve cyclical structure**:

-   you do something through a learning method;
-   you get feedback;
-   you reflect on the feedback;
-   and integrate it into your learning; 
-   and then you do it again.

### Choose your resources
You can distinguish at least **four principal types**:

-   Physical tools
-   Knowledge materials
-   Human resources
-   Package trainings
### Organise your timetable
To design a balanced and relevant typical learning week, I suggest that you follow the following steps:

1.  Schedule your time for rest, social and family life or hobbies, in order to define your minimum quality-of-life threshold. 
    
2.  Identify the various periods that generally make up your week. You can distinguish, e.g. work time, travel time and free time.
    
3.  Next, try to allocate the right activities to the right time periods.
    
Ideally, **deliberate practice** (with a performance goal) should be central to your daily schedule. If you are already practising full-time in the field in which you want to progress, it will be enough for you to bring learning into the heart of that practice. Otherwise, you must be satisfied with second-choice time periods. 
        
If you haven't allocated deliberate practice, you could use your free time to do **guided sessions**. 
        
Reserve **complementary activities** for moments 
when you cannot be more active, e.g. while travelling or walking.

Take a moment, each week and each month, to review your progress. If you realise that you are not progressing as planned, you will need to review your schedule. However, if you have not kept any record of your monthly, weekly or daily activity, you will not be able to set corrective actions. That's a good reason to record your learning time.
_If you can't measure it, you can't improve it._

Prioritise sessions that are:
-   Active
-   Short
-   Frequent
-   Regular
-   Interspersed with time to relax
-   Documented

## 4- Apply accelerated learning techniques
By accelerated learning techniques, you should understand: "productivity techniques applied to learning".

### Manage your learning environment
In the first section, you learned to adopt a learning stance. In other words, how to create **internal conditions** favourable to learning.
To create optimal **external conditions**, systematically identify and reduce all the frictions holding back your learning, which make you lose time and willpower.

In his book _Brain Rules: 12 Principles for Surviving and Thriving at Work, Home, and School,_ John Medina emphasises the importance of physical exercise for maintaining and developing intellectual performance.  If one believes the numerous research studies that he quotes, including half an hour of physical exercise per day (walking, running, moving in some way), in your learning plan, is anything but a waste of time.

### Accelerate your progress through active learning

Active learning gives you a general rule of conduct, applicable to any learning session and across all fields.
