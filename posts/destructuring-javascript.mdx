The two most used data structures in JavaScript are Object and Array.
The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects into distinct variables.


Destructuring is **NOT DESTRUCTIVE** , the array (or object) is not modified.
The destructuring assignment uses similar syntax, but on the left-hand side of the assignment to define what values to unpack from the sourced variable.

```js
const x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const [y, z] = x;
console.log(x);
console.log(y);
```
### destructure objects 

```js
const obj = {a: 'algun titulo', b: 'otro titulo'};
const {a, b} = obj; 
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
```
This capability is similar to features present in languages such as Perl and Python.

If we want to assign a property to a variable with another name we can set the variable name using a colon:

```js
let options = {
title: 'Menu',
width: 100,
height: 200
};
let {width: w} = options;
console.log(w)
```

#### Ignore Elements Using Commas
Unwanted elements of the array can also be thrown away via an extra comma

```js
let names = ['Herbert West', 'Waltham', 'Charles Fort'];
let [nombreUno, , nombreDos] = names;
console.log(nombreUno);
console.log(nombreDos);
```

#### The ...rest
Usualy, if the array is longer than the list at the left the extra items are omitted.
If we'd like also to gather all that follows we can add one more parameter that gets "the rest" using three dots and a name
...[name variable]

```js
let a, b, rest;
[a, b] = [10, 20];
console.log(a);
// expected output 10

console.log(b);
// expected output 20

[a, b, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60];
console.log(rest);
// expected output [30, 40, 50, 60]
```
