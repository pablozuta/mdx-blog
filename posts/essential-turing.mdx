excerpt: Alan Turing was one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. In 1935, aged 22, he developed the mathematical theory upon which all subsequent stored-program digital computers are modeled.

### Alan Turing 1912-1954

Alan Mathison Turing was born on 23 June 1912 in London; he died on 7 June 1954 at his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire.
Turing contributed to logic, mathematics, biology, philosophy, cryptanalysis, and formatively to the areas later known as computer science, cognitive science, Artificial Intelligence, and Artificial Life.

In 1936 Turing left Cambridge for the United States in order to continue his research at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/). There in 1938 he completed a Ph.D. entitled ‘Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals’, subsequently published under the same title. Now a classic, this work addresses the implications of Gödel’s famous incompleteness result.

Turing’s contribution to the Allied victory was a state secret and the only recognition he received, the Order of the British Empire, was in the circumstances derisory.
In 1945, the war over, Turing was recruited to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in London, his brief to design and develop an electronic digital computer, a concrete form of the universal Turing machine.
His design (for the Automatic Computing Engine or ACE) was more advanced than anything else then under consideration on either side of the Atlantic. While waiting for the engineers to build the ACE, Turing and his group pioneered the science of computer programming, writing a library of sophisticated mathematical programmes for the planned machine.

Turing founded the field now called [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) and was a leading early exponent of the theory that the human brain is in effect a digital computer. In February 1947 he delivered the **earliest known public lecture to mention computer intelligence.**

In the end, the NPL’s engineers lost the race to build the world’s first working electronic stored-programme digital computer, an honour that went to the Computing Machine Laboratory at the University of Manchester in June 1948.
The concept of the universal Turing machine was a **fundamental infuence on the Manchester computer project**, via Newman, the project’s instigator.
In 1948, at Newman’s invitation, Turing took up the deputy directorship of the Computing Machine Laboratory (there was no Director). Turing spent the rest of his short career at Manchester University.

It was at Manchester, in March 1952, that he was prosecuted for homosexual activity, then a crime in Britain, and sentenced to a period of twelve months’ hormone ‘therapy’—the shabbiest of treatment from the country he had helped save, but which he seems to have borne with amused fortitude.

Towards the end of his life Turing pioneered the area now known as [Artificial Life](https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer-simulation). His 1952 article ‘The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis’ describes some of his research on the development of pattern and form in living organisms.
